He put a package of sliced ham into his cart. He went up front to the cashier. He gave the cashier $20 and got his change. He couldn’t wait to get home.

The news was on three channels. She didn’t want to see the news. The news depressed her. It was usually about accidents and murders. There was too much bad news on the TV news. She found a talk show to watch. It was Ellen. She liked Ellen. Ellen was a comedian. She told good jokes. She showed animals doing funny things. She gave expensive gifts to her fans occasionally. This show was a rerun, because Ellen’s \"live\" show was usually on at 4 o’clock. But that didn’t matter to Emily. All she wanted to do was relax. Her life was one problem after another.

  "It was a warm, sunny day. She put a hat on to keep the sun out of her eyes. She needed to visit her bank. She walked down to the corner. There were four buildings at the intersection. One was her bank. Opposite the bank was a fast food restaurant. The other two buildings were a dry cleaner and an office building. Before she arrived at the corner, she could smell the fried chicken. The restaurant was open seven days a week, and the odor of fried chicken was in the neighborhood daily. She was a vegetarian. She used to eat meat and fish. But that was before she found a dead cat in her dumpster one day. Of course, she had smelled the dead cat before she opened the dumpster lid. Everyone knows the smell of dead flesh. She knew that something in the dumpster was dead, but she didn’t know what. Just in case it was a human (some people dump their babies into dumpsters), she opened the lid. She saw the cat. Flies covered most of it. They were enjoying their meal. She loved cats. She had two of her own. A week later at a restaurant, she ordered a hamburger. She took one bite out of it, and almost gagged. She spit it out. All she could think about was the smell of that dead cat. That was the day she became a vegetarian.",

Good, he thought. He wouldn’t have to stand in a long line. He parked his car and walked over to the shopping cart area. He pulled out one of the carts and pushed it ahead of him into the store. Inside, he grabbed an alcohol wipe and wiped the handle of the cart. Then he grabbed another wipe and wiped his own hands. You can never be too careful, he thought. He turned left and walked over to the produce section. Today was his lucky day. Apples were on sale, a dollar a pound. Usually they were two dollars a pound or more. He put 10 apples into a plastic bag and weighed the bag. It was three pounds. He walked over to the bananas. They were the regular price, 79 cents a pound. He bought three pounds of bananas. When he saw the carrots, he remembered that he needed carrots, too. He put a two-pound bag of carrots into his cart. They were only $1.29.

It had started the second time she turned the key, but that made her nervous. Sooner or later, she might have to turn the key three times, then four times. She had called her mechanic. He said to bring the car in when she had time. When was that, she wondered. She worked two jobs. She was a clerk at a clothing store. She spent five days a week folding clothes or hanging them up on hangers. People who tried on clothes usually left them on the floor in the dressing room. They rarely folded them or hung them back up on the hangers. The store was only 15 minutes from her apartment, and parking was free. Also, she worked four nights a week at a restaurant. She was a waitress. She made good money from her tips. Usually, the customers were friendly and interesting. She liked her waitress job, but it was a 30-minute drive from her apartment. The restaurant closed at 10 p.m. She did not want to be stuck in the parking lot late at night if her car didn’t start. Her mechanic wasn’t open on weekends. She decided to ask her boss to give her a day off from the clothing store. Then she could still drive to the restaurant that night after her car was fixed. She would miss only one day of work.",

They looked at a map. \"Should we drive into the mountains, or along the coastline?\" he asked. She said it didn’t matter. The next day they got up early. They put the suitcase into the trunk. He drove to a gas station and filled up the tank. He drove onto the freeway and headed west. \"So, we’re going up the coast?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" he told her. \"Maybe we’ll see some whales,\" she said. A half hour later, they could see the ocean. They drove north on the two-lane highway. After another hour, he pulled over. They got out of the car and walked onto the beach. Even though it was windy and chilly, they saw surfers in the ocean. They were sitting on their boards, waiting for waves. She was shivering. He put his arm around her to help keep her warm. She smiled at him. \"Let’s continue driving,\" she said. \"We can pull over again when the sun is higher.\"",

  "Something was wrong. Did he have a hernia again, in the same place? Thirty years ago, he had a hernia. A doctor had repaired the hernia. Now he felt some pain. It was below his navel. It was to the left of his navel. It wasn’t a sharp pain. It was a dull ache. It had started about two months ago. Now it was getting worse. Now it was a constant ache. He called a few doctors. \"How much is a consult?\" he asked. One doctor said $300. Another doctor said $350. That’s a lot of money, he thought. Maybe this ache will go away. Maybe it’ll go away by itself. He decided to wait another week. Then I’ll make an appointment, he thought. I’ll spend the money. It’s a lot of money. But it’s cheaper to fix a small problem now than a big problem later.",

She said, \"Hello, Kim, how are you doing?\" Kim was his wife’s name. Who is this, he wondered. \"Who’s this?\" he asked. \"Who’s this?\" she asked. \"You called me.\" He didn’t answer. Now he realized who it was. It was some woman who called his wife occasionally. They had been classmates at school. His wife was polite to her. But his wife didn’t like her. She never returned this woman’s phone calls. He himself had never met or talked to her. \"Sorry, wrong number,\" he said.",
  "Everything’s a hassle, he thought. The smallest thing is a hassle. Taking the cap off the toothpaste tube is a hassle. Squeezing the toothpaste tube is a hassle. Putting the toothpaste on the toothbrush is a hassle. Brushing his teeth is a hassle. Life is just one hassle after another. \"You always exaggerate,\" his wife said. \"Not everything is a hassle.\" He thought about that. Could his wife be right? Are some things not a hassle? How about eating food? That’s not a hassle. How about taking a hot shower? That’s not a hassle. How about reading? How about watching a good TV program? How about sleeping?

Eating, showering, reading, watching TV, and sleeping aren’t a hassle. \"Okay, I won’t exaggerate anymore,\" he said to his wife. \"I won’t say that everything is a hassle.",
  "He was in his bedroom. He smelled food. The food smelled like chicken. It smelled good. A neighbor must be cooking dinner, he thought. But how could he smell his neighbor’s dinner? The smell couldn’t come through his apartment’s heating vent. That vent was for his apartment only. So where was the smell coming from? He walked to the front door. He opened it. There was no smell in the hallway outside the door. He walked into the living room. There was no smell in the living room. He walked back into the bedroom. He could smell the food again. The bedroom was the only place he could smell the food. It was winter. All the windows were closed.

It broke my umbrella.\" She changed into dry clothes. She sat down at her computer. He opened her umbrella. He examined it. I can fix this, he thought. He opened another umbrella. It wasn’t broken. He compared the two umbrellas. He grabbed a pair of pliers. He went to work on the broken umbrella. Three hours later, she got up from her computer. She walked into the bedroom. She saw him working on the umbrella. \"What are you doing?\" she asked. He said, \"I’m trying to fix your umbrella, but I’m about to give up.\" She said, \"Give up already! I only paid $7 for it.

Maybe all the rolls were no good. He blew his nose. His wife came home. She went into the bathroom. She came out of the bathroom. She was holding about ten sheets. Some were 2-ply. Some were mostly 1-ply. \"What’s this?\" she said. He said, \"I don’t know. Sometimes they make mistakes.\" She said, \"Did you get it on sale at a secondhand store?

Where did he walk to? Why didn’t he walk straight back to his hotel? The police wanted to know. His family and friends wanted to know. He wasn’t drunk. He wasn’t sick.

He gave the book title to the clerk. She typed the title into her computer. The price was $59. Shipping was free. The number of pages was 190. \"Wait a minute,\" he said. \"I just looked at this book online. It has 240 pages, not 190. Where did 50 pages go?\" She said, \"That’s really strange.

She carried a heavy purse everywhere. Many real estate forms were in her purse. Many keys were in her purse. When she came home, she was tired. Her feet hurt. Her back hurt. He decided to help his wife. He took the laundry basket downstairs to the laundry room. His wife always separated her colored clothes from her white clothes. He thought about that. Why spend extra money on two washers? He didn’t separate her colored and white clothes. He stuffed all her clothes into one washer. He selected Hot Wash. This will make her happy, he thought. A hot wash will kill all the germs. She hates germs. He was proud of himself.",
  "A while later, he put her clothes into the dryer. He selected Hot Dry. That’ll kill the rest of the germs, he thought. The dryer finished. He took her clothes upstairs. His wife came home.

Then she screamed. \"What’s the matter?\" he asked. She said, \"Look at my blouse! What happened to my white blouse? It’s all different colors. What did you do to my blouse?!\" She looked at her black slacks on the bed. She picked them up. \"What’s wrong with these?\" she said. He didn’t say anything. She took off her brown slacks. She tried on her black slacks. She couldn’t get into them. \"You shrank my pants!\" she screamed.",
  "\"Daylight Saving Time starts tomorrow. Please change my clock,\" his wife said. He said he would try. He hated changing clocks twice a year. He never changed his car clock. He couldn’t figure out how to do it. His car clock was wrong from March to November every year. His wife’s clock was on her nightstand. It was a clock and a timer. It ran on a single battery. The clock had many buttons. He pressed \"Clock.\" Nothing happened. He pressed \"Hour.\" Nothing happened. He pressed both buttons at the same time. Nothing happened. He pressed \"Start.\" He pressed \"Stop.\" He pressed \"Recall.\" He pressed \"Clear.\" He pressed \"Minute.\" He pressed \"Second.\" He pressed \"T1.\" He pressed \"T2.\" Nothing happened. He pressed his head between his hands. His wife walked in. \"Oh, I forgot to tell you,\" she said. \"You have to press the button on the back of the clock first.\"",

There was no blank space to sign his name. He was done. That was easy, he thought. He folded the questionnaire. He put it into the big envelope. He sealed the envelope. The envelope said, \"Postage will be paid by U.S. Census Bureau.\" Liars, he thought. Another example of government lies. Who pays the workers at the U.S. Census Bureau? We do, he thought. The taxpayers pay the workers. The taxpayers pay all government workers. Who pays for all the postage? We do, he thought. The taxpayers pay for all the postage. No government agency pays for anything. Taxpayers pay for everything.",
  "He opened his mailbox. He looked at the envelope. It was the U.S. Census questionnaire. He shook his head. How long would this take, he wondered. He went back to his apartment. He opened the envelope. A questionnaire and a big envelope were inside. He unfolded the questionnaire. He read the instructions. What a pleasant surprise, he thought. This looks easy. He only had to answer 17 questions. They were on the first two pages. He picked up a pen. He filled in the boxes for his name. He filled in the boxes for his date of birth. He filled in the boxes for his phone number. He answered the questions. How many people live in your home? Do you own or rent your home? What is your sex? What is your age? Are you Hispanic? What is your race? Do you live somewhere else sometimes? He marked an X in the appropriate boxes.",
  "The soup was ready. He took the pot off the burner. He ate the soup. Delicious, he thought. This pot makes delicious soup. He cleaned the pot. He put it back on the stove. Wait till she sees this, he thought. She’ll want to cook everything in it. His wife came home. She examined the pot. \"Take this back,\" she said. \"Stop buying cheap crap.\" He said, \"What’s cheap about it? It’s stainless steel. Feel how heavy it is. Look at this glass cover. You can watch your food cooking!\" She said, \"It wobbles. It will spill. It won’t cook food properly. Take it back!\" He took it back to the store. \"Where is the stick-on price label? Did you use this pot?\" the clerk asked. He said, \"Well, yes, but only one time. And I washed it.",

That wasn’t cheap for a pot. His wife would like the pot. She couldn’t say that it was a cheap pot. A cheap pot is light. A cheap pot doesn’t have a glass cover. A cheap pot costs much less than $13. He put the pot on the stove. What’s this, he wondered. The pot wobbled. It didn’t sit flat on the burner. He picked up the pot. He looked at the bottom. He put it back on the burner. It wobbled again. It was just a little wobble. But it was definitely a wobble. Maybe the burner wasn’t flat. He poured a can of soup into the pot. He turned on the burner.",

  "Her wrist hurt. She thought it was nerve damage. But she wouldn’t see a doctor, and she wouldn’t stop using her hand. Maybe he could help. He went to the drugstore. He found a wrist wrap. It wrapped around the wrist. It prevented the wrist from moving. The thumb and fingers were left uncovered. The palm was left uncovered. This is perfect, he thought. She’ll love it. He took it home. He showed it to her. She held it up to her nose. \"Take it back!\" she said. \"It smells. It smells like rubber.\" He said, \"Of course it smells like rubber. It’s made of rubber!\" She had a nose like a dog. He took it back. He found a different wrist wrap. It was anti-bacterial. \"No Odors,\" the package said. He took it home. She held it up to her nose. \"This smells worse than the other one!\" she said.",
  "Norm woke up to go to the bathroom. While washing his hands, he looked in the mirror. The circular \"bump\" on the side of his nose looked bigger. The bump looked puffy. It was soft. It didn’t hurt. Maybe it was just some fat cells, as he had read online. Or, maybe it was skin cancer. His dad had had skin cancer. Doctors had cut out one suspicious spot after another. They had cut out spots from all over his face. Norm wondered, Like father, like son? He hoped he was just getting a little fat ring on his face. Not a big deal, except it was a little ugly to look at. But cancer would be even uglier. Cancer would eat that ring and his nose, too! He decided to make an appointment with a dermatologist. He went back to bed. He hoped he wouldn’t dream about his nose.",
  "They were watching a TV commercial with sad music. The TV commercial was about an old married couple. They had both had health problems. He had lost his job. They had used their savings to pay for health care. They went through all their savings. Now they were barely surviving on social security. They lived in a tiny apartment.  \"Look at those poor people,\" Barry said. Eva said, \"They’re not poor people. They’re actors!\" He said, \"No, they’re not. He has no right hand. His wife has no left foot. Those are real people! They’re suffering. What kind of country is this? We’re the richest country in the world. How does our government allow this?\" She said, \"It’s not the government’s fault. It’s those two people’s fault. They shouldn’t have gotten sick. They should have saved more. They should have planned better. Don’t blame the government.",
  "They stopped at the cookie store. His wife wanted something sweet. \"Buy me some cookies,\" she said. He said, \"Sure.\" He looked at the price list. The cookies were $1 each. He ordered two cookies. His wife couldn’t believe it. \"I don’t want just two cookies,\" she said. \"Buy six!\" The price list said, \"Six Cookies for $5.99.\" So, at least he’d save a penny. He ordered six cookies. His wife walked out of the cookie store. She waited on the sidewalk. The clerk gave him a bag of cookies. He put 50 cents into the tip jar. He made sure the clerk saw him do it. He waited. \"Where’s my penny?\" he asked. She looked at him. She laughed. He repeated his question. This time she just smiled at him. He looked for the manager. Then he thought about his wife waiting outside. It’s only a penny, he told himself.",
  "The Wilsons invited the Carters to dinner. Mr. Carter was Mr. Wilson’s boss. The Wilsons had a one-bedroom apartment. Their sofa was in the living room. It seated two people. It still looked new. They protected the sofa with towels. They spread the towels on top of the cushions. They removed the towels when friends visited. Mrs. Wilson spent the day preparing dinner. Mr. Wilson spent the day cleaning the apartment. He also ran some errands. They were both very busy all day. The Carters showed up at 7 p.m. Mr. Wilson walked them to the sofa. \"Have a seat,\" he said. \"I’ll be right back.\" He went into the kitchen. When he returned, the Carters were sitting at the dining table. That’s strange, he thought. The sofa was much more comfortable than the dining table chairs. He sat down with the Carters at the dining table. They were talking.",
  "He asked the cashier for a price check. The shirt was $4, not $2. He told her, \"Forget it.\" The jacket was only $2, not $4. He couldn’t believe it. He held up the jacket. He looked at it carefully. No stains, no rips, no holes, and only $2? What a deal! The cashier grabbed a plastic bag. He said, \"Thank you, no bag.\" He put the jacket on and pulled the zipper up. He walked outside. The jacket was perfect. He felt warm. He started walking. He looked at his reflection in a window. The jacket fit well. What a deal! A while later the temperature rose. He was getting warm. I’ll just unzip my jacket, he thought. He pulled down on the jacket zipper. It didn’t move. He pulled again. Nothing happened. Again. Nothing. He pulled the jacket over his head. He dropped it into a nearby trashcan.",
  "He wondered if it was cold outside. He was going to walk to Pier 88. He’d heard that cruise ships were in town. He looked outside his eighth-floor window. Many people on the sidewalk below were wearing short-sleeve shirts. But the radio had said the temperature was 67 degrees. That’s not exactly hot, he thought. It was only 10 a.m. It would probably warm up by noon. He put on jeans and a T-shirt. He walked outside. It was a little chilly. Maybe it’ll get warmer as I walk, he thought. But it didn’t. He went into Conway’s, a budget clothing store. He went upstairs to the men’s department. He found a long-sleeve shirt in the $2 section. Then he saw a jacket in the $4 section. It was much heavier than the shirt. Neither the shirt nor the jacket had a price tag. He took them to the cashier.",

He said yes. She asked if he was driving. He said no. She asked him to imagine a ladder. The bottom rung was number one. The top rung was number ten. \"How satisfied are you with your life?\" she asked. He said number five. \"Is your life better now than five years ago?\" she asked. He said no. \"Do you think your life will be better five years from now?\" she asked. He said no. She asked many more questions. Suddenly, he looked at the clock. He thought, This call might be costing me roaming charges. He didn’t trust his phone company. \"I have to go!\" he said, and hung up.",
  "Dan saw an ad in Metro, the free city newspaper. A new apartment building was about to open in Manhattan. Some apartments were set aside for low-income people. Applicants had to send in a postcard postmarked by May 17. The first 5,000 applicants would receive an application form. He couldn’t believe his luck. It was May 17. It was 3:30. He tore the ad out of the paper. He walked to the main post office on 8th Avenue. He asked the clerk for a postcard. \"We don’t sell postcards,\" the clerk said. Dan said, \"The post office doesn’t sell postcards?\" The clerk said, \"Not anymore. Now we sell greeting cards. They make more money.\" Dan asked, \"Do you sell stamps for postcards?\" The clerk said, \"Of course! How many do you want?\" Dan bought one stamp.

They sell greeting cards now.\" The clerk said, \"Really? When did that happen? That’s pretty weird, isn’t it? A post office that doesn’t sell postcards.\" Dan walked a few more blocks south. Not one store sold postcards. He decided to try Borders on 7th Avenue. Borders sold postcards. They were $1 each. He bought one. Walking back toward the post office, he entered Duane Reade, a popular drugstore. Maybe it sold postcards, and cheaper. It did, and they were only a quarter. He would return the Borders postcard later. He walked into the post office. He put the stamp on the postcard. He addressed it. He dropped it into the slot. It was 4:30. He had beaten the deadline!

  "Millions of gallons of oil were pouring into the Gulf of Mexico. A pipeline had broken. The drilling platform had burned and sunk. Workers had died. The oil poured out of the broken pipe, a mile beneath the surface of the gulf. The oil company tried to stop the flow. It poured golf balls into the pipe. It poured mud into the pipe. It put a steel cap on the pipe. Nothing worked. Oil was on the water. Oil was in the water. Oil was on the beaches. Oil was in the marshes. It was killing fish and birds. It was an environmental disaster. Fishermen stopped fishing. Nobody would buy their fish. Nobody would eat their fish. It was an economic disaster. In May, the oil company said it might be able to stop the flow by September. \"Our vacations are ruined,\" said tourists. \"Our livelihoods are ruined,\" said locals.",
  "He asked them if they would feel more comfortable on the sofa. They said they were just fine where they were. He went back into the kitchen. He helped his wife with the food. They brought the food out to the dining table. They sat down with the Carters. Mr. Wilson poured wine into everyone’s glass. They all said, \"Cheers!\" They drank wine, ate dinner, and talked. They had mango slices and vanilla ice cream for dessert. The Carters left at about 9:00. The Wilsons cleared the table and washed the dishes. \"I’m so tired,\" said Mrs. Wilson. She wanted to sit down and watch some TV. They walked over to the sofa. \"Oh, you forgot to take the towels off the sofa,\" she said. \"What’s this? Tell me they didn’t see this.\" She pointed at a big stain on one of the colored towels. Well, that explains that, he thought.",
  "She said the oil spill wasn’t a big problem. \"How can you say that?\" he asked. \"Millions of gallons of oil are pouring into the ocean.\" She said, \"It’s a big ocean. The oil’s a drop in the bucket. Besides, oil and water are natural elements, so they can get along with each other.\" He agreed that they are natural elements. He said that people are natural elements, too. Did that mean that oil and people could get along with each other? Would she drink an ounce of oil? Would she swim in an oily ocean? \"Of course not!\" she said. \"That’s unnatural.\" He said that fish were swimming in oily water. Seabirds were eating those oily fish. \"But they’re animals,\" she said. \"They adapt to these things.\" He said that dead fish were lying on beaches. Dead birds were lying on beaches. \"That’s not adapting,\" he said. \"That’s a-dying.\"",
  "It was Memorial Day. An Osprey flew to a city park. About 200 people were there. They were waiting to see the Osprey up close. They were excited. An Osprey is a military plane. It flies like a plane. But it lands and takes off like a helicopter. It has two huge propellers. Arriving at the park, the Osprey started its slow descent. The powerful wind created by its propellers bent the trees. The Osprey kept descending. The wind was like a hurricane. Trees bent over. Tree branches cracked. Branches crashed to the ground. Leaves flew everywhere. Trashcans blew over. They started rolling around. Paper and plastic flew everywhere. Dogs started barking. Children started crying. They ran. Parents ran after their children. Others ran from the flying trash. Everyone was running away from the Osprey. The Osprey landed. The pilot got out. He looked around. Where is everybody, he wondered.",

They could do almost anything they wanted. But they couldn’t touch her. A security guard stood near her. It was the fifth day. Five minutes before her final hour was up, a man walked up.

  "In baseball, 27 batters up and 27 batters down is a perfect game. On average, a perfect game occurs about once every six years. In 2010, two perfect games occurred in May alone. Then in June a third perfect game occurred. But there was a problem. That perfect game had an imperfect umpire. The first base umpire made a bad call. He called the 27th batter safe at first. The batter was actually out. The batter had grounded to the first baseman. He threw the ball to the pitcher covering first base. The ball beat the batter by half a step. It was a routine ground out. The players knew it. The fans in the stadium knew it. The fans watching on TV knew it. Everybody knew it! Later, the first base umpire saw the TV replay. \"The biggest call of my life,\" he said sadly, \"and I blew it.\"",

It was near shops and restaurants. The boss wanted to save money, of course. They moved into their new office on Tuesday. It was in an old building. It was in a poor neighborhood. Buses and trains were blocks away. Shops and restaurants were blocks away. Their new office was on the third floor. It had no partitions or privacy. Desks were jammed together. The back of one chair almost touched the back of another chair. The coatroom was a tiny closet. The bathrooms were down the hallway. Both of the tiny elevators broke down on Friday.

  "\"You forgot to say thank you,\" said Lorraine, the apartment building manager. \"Thank you for what?\" Sid asked. \"Remember your email?\" she asked. He’d emailed her about a safety hazard. He had suggested installing a window in the lobby door. Sometimes people leaving the lobby pushed the door open hard. A window would allow people leaving to see people entering. A window would help prevent people leaving from knocking down people entering. Two days later, the door had a new window. \"See what quick service we gave you?\" she said. Sid wondered why he should be thanking her. Someone who got knocked down could sue the building owner. The owner would have to settle lawsuits. Sid’s suggestion would help prevent lawsuits, saving the owner money. In fact, by reporting safety hazards, Sid was actually doing management’s job. Lorraine should be grateful to him.

He referred her to a specialist, who found a Stage III malignant tumor in her chest. After Tina’s surgery, Barker stopped his pawing. Thinking he might be able to sniff out cancer in children, Tina took Barker to Covenant House on 41st Street.",
  "The police searched high and low, but they never found a gun, a shell casing, or a bullet. Nevertheless, she went on trial for murder. Her lawyer said, \"Don’t worry. They can’t prove a thing. Even their eyewitness’s testimony is beyond belief.\" The prosecutor put her on the witness stand. He said, \"Please show the jury how you killed the man.\" She pointed her finger at the prosecutor. Just as she \"pulled the trigger,\" he ducked. The judge and jury laughed. After closing arguments, the jury deliberated for two whole minutes. The jury foreman declared her not guilty. Afterward, her lawyer said, \"You know, I believe that you actually did it with your finger. I think the prosecutor does too. There’s a lot of strange things in life. So, weren’t you worried that you would kill the prosecutor?\" She said, \"No. My finger only fires when I’m scared to death.\"",
  "Rod was fishing. It started to rain. That didn’t bother him. Then he saw lightning and heard thunder. That did bother him. He decided to pack up. Just then he got a bite. It felt like a big one! This was going to be fun. Whack! Lightning struck Rod. When he came to, he was in a hospital. A doctor said, \"Nobody knows how or why you’re alive. The boulder you were standing on was split in two, along with the tree next to it. But you don’t have a mark on you.\" Rod wondered what happened to his fish. He got out of the hospital two days later. That evening, he watched \"Jeopardy\" on TV. He knew each answer, even before Alex announced it. And he knew all the correct questions. He’d never known more than a few correct questions before. I have a mark in me, he mused.",
  "Olga said yes. He said the job required a lot of driving. He asked, \"Do you have a driver’s license?\" She said yes. He asked if she was available for an interview the following Wednesday. She said, \"Yes, but let me be clear about something first. I have a driver’s license, but I don’t have a car. Do I need my own car, too?\" He said yes. She said, \"I don’t have one, so I’m out. But let me ask you another question. Why don’t they state this requirement on the canvass letter? If I had seen ’personal car required,’ I would have checked a No box. Then you wouldn’t be wasting our time with this phone call. Doesn’t that make sense?\" He said, \"It certainly does. I don’t know why this isn’t being done. Let me bring it up at my next meeting. Good luck with your job hunting.\"",
  "Death was not a problem for Kevin — dying was. He wondered what percentage of people actually died while sleeping in bed. According to polls, that’s how most people want to go. But few do. He figured, with his luck, he wouldn’t be one of the few. That left dying by accident or disease. There were other ways to die, of course, but not as common as those two. He was always careful when crossing the street; he looked both ways even when crossing one-way streets. That had saved him several times from getting struck by bicyclists. Although killer bicyclists were always on his mind, he crossed off \"accident.\" That left \"disease.\" He used to think that diseases, like getting old and looking old, were for other people. But recently his doctor had told him that he had cellulitis and diverticulosis. He asked, \"How? Why?\"  His doctor had shrugged his shoulders.",
  "Olga took several computerized tests in downtown Manhattan. The tests cost her $25 to $45 each. A passing score put her on an eligibility list for a city or state job. About 18 months after her first test, an agency sent her a canvass letter. The letter stated her list number. Also, it stated the job title, salary, borough, PT or FT, and shift. The bottom half of the letter contained nine boxes followed by Yes or No and a short, descriptive sentence. She checked the first box. Its sentence said: Yes, I am interested in this position; I can report to work by (date). She mailed the letter back, with her resume. She received letters from other agencies. She responded to each one the same way. Eventually, a supervisor called. He told her his name, agency, and the job title, and asked if she wanted to interview for it.",
  "Then, instead of dismissing diseases because they were only for other people, Kevin started worrying about which painful disease was going to end his life. Talking to his brother one day, he said, \"You’re lucky. You’ve already had appendicitis.\" Jason asked, \"What’s ’lucky’ about that?\" Kevin said, \"You never have to worry about getting it while you’re on a cross-country flight, that’s what.\" Jason said, \"But you never fly, so you don’t have to worry about it, either.\" Kevin said, \"Yes, but I use the subway every day.\" Jason said, \"Cross-country?! Just ride the local trains. If you feel deathly ill, get off at the next stop and take a cab to an ER. Just stop worrying about it. They say that worrying about something just makes it happen.\" Kevin said, \"’Worrying makes it happen.’ What a great suggestion. Thanks.",
  "Rod opened the NY Times. Maybe now he was good at crossword puzzles. He did the whole puzzle in minutes. It was a breeze. His TV was showing an ad for the MegaMillions and PowerBall lotteries. He had never won even a dollar playing either game. But he \"saw\" the winning numbers. He bought two tickets. His tickets won. He played the next four games. He won all four. He was worldwide media news. People accused him of cheating. People hated him for stealing \"their\" winnings. Someone shot and killed him. A spokesman for the Cancer Society angrily told the media, \"Rod had donated 95 percent of his winnings to cancer research. He said he wanted to save mankind from cancer.\" A reporter said, \"Why didn’t he tell everyone? Then he’d probably still be alive.\" The spokesman said, \"He didn’t want to be seen as patting himself on the back.\"",
  "The doctor asked, \"Now, how much water do you drink a day?\" Sheila said, \"I’m not a big fan of water. It has no taste. I drink tea and juice.\" He said, \"The sugar in the juice is drying out your vocal cords. Stop drinking the juice, and start drinking eight glasses of water every day.\" She said, \"I can’t do that. I have a small bladder. I’ll be visiting the bathroom all day long. The kids will start talking. The principal will hear all the talk, and I’ll get fired — for drinking water! Besides, water doesn’t lubricate vocal cords. It goes right past them and straight into my stomach. Then it goes straight into my bladder, and then I go straight into the bathroom. Water doesn’t make a drop of sense.\" He said, \"Who’s the doctor here!? Try what I’m telling you, and I’ll see you in four weeks.\"",
  "Sheila went to her ear-nose-throat doctor. She spent twenty minutes filling out various forms. Why, she wondered, can’t all my medical information be in the Cloud? Every time she saw a new doctor, she had to provide the same basic information. The doctor finally saw her. She said, \"I can’t talk for long periods. My voice gets dry and raspy. I have to suck on lozenges all the time. But the lozenges leave a bad taste in my mouth, and of course they interfere with my enunciation. I’m a teacher. I need to be able to talk. A teacher without a voice is like a doctor without a Mercedes.\" He said, \"Many lozenges contain menthol. Menthol actually dries out your throat. Try non-menthol lozenges.\" said, \"Non-menthol? I’ve never even heard of non-menthol. Can you name one, please?\" He said, \"Not offhand. But they’re out there.",
  "It was 8:30 a.m. In an hour, Dr. Eduard was going to inject Lidocaine, a painkiller, into Brad’s right cheek right next to his nose. Five weeks ago, Dr. Marina had injected Lidocaine into the same place in order to get a biopsy. She had cut out a section of a puffy, white circle with a nearly dime-size diameter. The subsequent lab report indicated basal cell carcinoma. Five years ago and two years ago, two different dermatologists had told Brad that the puffy circle was just a \"fat deposit.\" Brad was worried. He’d read that such cancer was rarely fatal but often disfiguring. Had the cancer had time to grow into his cheekbone? Dr. Marina had said the \"Mohs\" surgery might last all day. Operating on several patients today, Dr. Eduard would cut, examine each specimen microscopically, and cut again until he’d removed all the cancerous tissue from each patient.",
  "He’d just finished reading a textbook full of typos. Did they bother to read this book before they published it, he wondered. He couldn’t believe that they charged $70 for it. He’d circled all the errors with a red pen, so he couldn’t get his money back. But he could call the publisher. Cheryl answered. He told her about all the typos. She said, \"You know, you’re the first person to say anything about that.\" He couldn’t believe it. He asked how many people had bought the book. She said 1,500 people had bought it. \"And I’m the only one to complain?\" he asked. She said yes. He asked how many people had returned the book. She said nobody had returned it. He couldn’t believe it. \"I circled 215 misspellings in the book,\" he said, \"and there are only 200 pages!\" Cheryl said, \"Maybe we should submit it to Guinness.\"",

  "Not religious, Brad said a little prayer anyway, hoping that God would ignore his hypocrisy. At 5:30 p.m., Dr. Eduard was suturing the raw hole in Brad’s face. The day had been completely pain free. The doctor had had to cut into Brad’s face three times. The cancer hadn’t invaded bone. Throughout the day, Brad had noticed other patients in the waiting room with big, white bandages on their faces. Two patients had bandages on their mouths. Dr. Eduard sutured Brad’s face with dissolving stitches and then with regular stitches. He explained the follow-up care that Brad needed to do and gave him prescriptions for an ointment and for pain. He told Brad to return in a week to get the black, outer stitches removed. Brad thanked God as he walked to the bus stop. I don’t deserve it, he thought, but thank You for looking out for me today.",

That’s what Father Dave asked.\" Mike said, \"Five minutes? For a man who lived 87 years?!\" Mike managed to pare the eulogy down to ten minutes. Fifty minutes after the funeral mass had begun, Mike took his place at the lectern near the altar. He began, \"Fr. Dave gave me only five minutes to praise Dad. Frankly, it would take me five hours to do him justice.\" Then, looking at his audience, he began to talk lovingly about his dad. Ten minutes later, as Mike was nearing his finish, he heard the priest, behind Mike and to his left, start talking loudly about Mike’s dad. Startled, Mike turned around, looked at Fr.

  "Ann and Bob were in love. They were going to get married in July. They had known each other since they were in the third grade. They were both 20 years old. True love was something that Ann and Bob knew everything about. There was hardly anything they disagreed about. Even when they disagreed, they settled the disagreement in such a way that both were totally happy. This was truly a match made in heaven.  \r\nThey had already made plans for the wedding. It was going to be a big wedding. Every relative from both families had already been notified about the date. All their friends knew about the big day. The invitations were already printed. The priest, the church, the reception hall, and the limousine service were ready to go.  \r\nNothing was being left to chance. This was going to be the happiest day of their lives. Ann had gone to several wedding web sites for ideas and help. Of course, she had also consulted her mother, grandmothers, aunts, and married friends about how to plan the perfect wedding.  \r\nEach one of them tried to tell her that there was no such thing as a perfect wedding. There was always at least one thing, or more usually one person, that made the wedding a seeming disaster at the time. But of course, like the disaster that happens on one’s vacation, that incident or person would be what makes the wedding more memorable.\r\n\"Oh, you should have been at my wedding,\" said Aunt Mabel to Ann. \"My brother James was in charge of the rings that Kyle and I were going to exchange. On the wedding day, James presented the ring to Kyle, who put it on my finger. An hour later at the reception, I took the ring off to admire it and read the inscription. I gasped. The jeweler had spelled my name ’Mable’ as in table. My name, as you know, dear, is spelled Mabel as in label. So I went to the ladies’ room and cried for almost half an hour. No one could console me.”\r\n\"So, the moral of the story, my dear,\" chimed in Aunt Prudence, \"is to make sure that Uncle James isn’t in charge of getting your rings engraved. Not that you would have a problem. How could anyone misspell your name — it only has three letters, and two of them are the same.\" \r\n\"Aunt Prudence, you know that isn’t true,\" said Ann. \"Half the people I know spell my name with an ’e.’ But, Uncle James is not in charge of our rings, so I’m not worried.\"",
  "Renee had been married for a long, long time. Her favorite part of being married was the weekend, when she was with her two horses. On the weekend, Renee was at the stables from morning until dark. She fed, groomed, and rode her horses. She was an excellent rider. She would ride the horses bareback on Saturday, and then she would saddle them up on Sunday.\r\nRenee loved parades. She used to say, \"A parade isn’t a parade without a horse.\" Renee loved parades almost as much as she loved her horses. She belonged to an email list of volunteers for parades. She regularly checked out the state website list of parades to see if there were any new parades that she didn’t know about. All the state parades were organized in her computer. In the Parades file, she listed the date, drive time and distance, parade time, contact people, and other details she felt were important.\r\nShe knew the parade director of every town within a four-hour drive. She never stayed overnight. She always left the parade in time to get her horses back to the stables before \"bedtime.\" She had to feed them before they turned in. Her horses seemed to like parades, too. They knew a few tricks that always impressed the children. \r\nRenee was very generous with her time and her horses. But owning horses wasn’t cheap. She had to rent the stables, and there were always veterinarian and feed bills. Renee knew how to cope with expenses, though. Her vet always gave her a 10-percent discount for paying cash. She always bought the no-name, generic feed for the horses. Her vet had told her it was just as healthful and tasty as the brand name stuff. She always bought economy gasoline. And on parade days, Renee always packed her own lunch and ate with her horses.",
  "Because Debra had just bought a new laptop computer, she decided that she must start cutting back on some expenses if she could. Her long distance phone bill was one expense that sprang to mind. She was paying almost $30 a month to Horizon, her local phone company. That $30 covered her residence line and various taxes, surcharges, funds, fees, and services. It also covered her local phone calls — those to locations within 12 miles.\r\nBut she was paying another $40-$80 a month talking to her best friend and to her boyfriend, both of whom lived more than 12 miles away from her. But how could she not talk to her best friend and to her boyfriend? Could she tell them she was having budget problems, so could they please call her in the future? Could she just call them less often — a lot less often?\r\nFortunately for Debra, she found the solution a month later, when she tearfully discovered that her boyfriend and her best friend were seeing each other behind Debra’s back. Debra saw them kissing in his car outside of a restaurant that all three of them liked to visit occasionally. Debra immediately called Horizon to cancel her long distance service. The female customer service representative asked if she was sure she wanted to do this. Debra said, \"Yes, I’m sure.

New selections every day. Only $29.95 a month!\" As much as she hated her ex-boyfriend, Debra knew that not all men were alike. Maybe Mr. Right was waiting for her on her computer screen.

  "Chelsea was a saleswoman. She worked for a medical equipment manufacturer to sell medical equipment to hospitals. She drove all over Los Angeles County five days a week. She was not the world’s most law-abiding driver. When all the freeway lanes were at a dead stop, she would scoot along the emergency lane. She rarely met a stop sign at an empty intersection that she obeyed. She usually slowed down enough to make sure the intersection was clear, and then zipped on through. She usually talked on her cell phone while driving. While driving and yakking, she would often drink a soda or eat a sandwich. Her hands, legs, and mouth were always busy while she was driving. She was born, she often bragged, to multitask.\r\nOne Friday afternoon Chelsea had to show a customer how to operate a new device. The customer was a slow learner, so Chelsea ended up leaving the hospital half an hour later than she had planned. Then, of course, she got stuck in Friday evening rush hour. She was going to be late for her date, but the nearby mountains blocked her cell phone from calling Sebastian and telling him.\r\nShe was already irritated, and things seemed to be getting worse.

All she had to do was run into the mailbox store, get the package weighed, and pay the clerk. \r\nThere was no line in the store. Everything was done so quickly that she was whistling while she walked back out to her car. Then she stopped whistling. There was an envelope on the windshield. She opened it slowly. She knew what it was, but not how much it was. She screamed when she saw the amount. A dog started barking.",

It starred the young and handsome Tad Biff and the young and beautiful Jenny Lopez.\r\nBarbara invited her sister Laura to the movie. Both of them were big fans of Tad, even though both of them were well over 40. Barbara had picked the 5 o’clock show on a Tuesday evening, figuring that the crowds would be thin.

  "Joan’s job is to use American Sign Language to enable instructors to communicate with English-speaking deaf students. She went to school for three years to get her certificate. According to Joan, learning ASL was not that difficult, but learning to be an excellent interpreter could take a lifetime.\r\nThree years after enrolling at Pierce College, Joan graduated as a Certified ASL Interpreter. Plenty of job opportunities were waiting for her. She likes the college environment, so she applied for a job at Newton Community College, a school with 28,000 students. There are 22 hearing-impaired students at NCC. Joan has worked with most of them.\r\nThey are very friendly with her. Often they invite her to have a cup of coffee after class. They talk about school and about what they hope to do after graduation. Sometimes the women talk about personal things, especially about how hard it is to find \"Mr. Right.\" Joan agrees with them, saying she herself has given up on finding him. They also talk about their favorite movies, books, and music. Even deaf people can \"hear\" music. Many are good dancers.\r\nJoan is one of the four interpreters on campus. Two are full-time; Joan works part-time. She accompanies a deaf student to class. The student sits in the front row. Joan usually sits near the teacher, facing the student. She signs as the teacher talks. If the class is less than 90 minutes long, there is only one interpreter per student. If the class is longer, there are two interpreters per student. They alternate; one interpreter will sign for 20 minutes, and then the other will.\r\nJoan will go back to school soon. She wants to become a Certified French Sign Language Interpreter. She already speaks French fluently; her mom taught it to her. Her mom also taught Joan that American men are hopeless. She frequently told Joan that only a French man knows how to make a woman feel like a woman. Joan idolizes her mom, and takes her advice to heart. It will take Joan about three more years to get certified.\r\nWhat then? Then she will leave California, move to Paris, find a romantic French boyfriend, and live happily ever after. That’s her plan.",
  "Benjamin was sick. He didn’t know how he got sick. He was feverish and tired. He had no appetite. His stomach hurt more often than not. At first he shrugged off the symptoms, figuring he had picked up a bug that would go away in a week or so. But it didn’t. It lingered. After three weeks, he dragged himself to Dr. Barkley. \r\nThe doctor did a few tests. Then he asked Benjamin if he had gone camping and drunk unsterilized stream water. Benjamin said the last time he had gone camping was in the army many years ago. \r\nThe doctor asked if Benjamin had eaten at any fast food restaurants in the past month, or eaten from one of the many lunch trucks in the Los Angeles area. Benjamin said that he ate fast food or lunch truck food every day at noon. \r\n\"That’s probably the source of your illness. You have hepatitis A, and you most likely got it from a food worker who didn’t wash his hands thoroughly after using the bathroom. It happens a lot.\" \r\n\"Holy cow! I’m not going to die, am I?\"\r\nThe doctor told him not to worry. A viral infection that attacks the liver, hepatitis A kills only about 100 people annually in the U.S. He told Benjamin to see him every two weeks, and to be prepared to take up to three months off from work so that he could rest, rest, rest. There is no cure for hepatitis A. Fortunately, most people survive; only a few don’t.\r\n\"And there’s another good thing about hepatitis A,\" Dr. Barkley said. \"Once you get it, you’re immune to it for the rest of your life.\"",
  "A routine check of the main building on the Rest in Peace Cemetery in Santa Fe turned up thousands of cardboard boxes containing the remains of cremated people. An inspector from the state’s Cemetery and Funeral Bureau found the boxes stacked neatly in various rooms of the cemetery’s main building. Instead of having names of the departed, most boxes simply had dates inscribed on them. The dates went all the way back to June 14, 1930.\r\nThe owner of the cemetery, Mrs. Marbles, said she had just bought the property a year ago. She said she had never even been in many of the rooms of the main building. She said that she had bought the cemetery solely for its land value.\r\n\"As we all know,\" she said, \"God keeps making people, but He’s not making any more land. It’s only a matter of time before all this land is going to be needed for the living. When that happens, this property will be worth at least ten times what I paid for it. I’m already in discussions with several condo developers.\" \r\nThe inspector said that it looked like most of the remains were from the 1930s to the 1970s. He figured that the people were probably homeless people whose bodies were never claimed at the funeral homes. The funeral homes cremated the bodies and then gave the remains to the cemetery for proper burial. He said that even though these remains were up to 75 years old, they would be buried with dignity and respect.\r\n\"After all,\" he said, \"all of these people had relatives at one time.

If it hits a populated area, the number of deaths will greatly exceed the 1,070 deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana.\r\nThree California quakes between 1987 and 1994 killed more than 100 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. From 1994 to 2000, the state spent several billion dollars reinforcing bridges, overpasses, and buildings. But budget problems have halted these repairs. Today, more than 1,000 schools and hospitals — not to mention thousands of other government and private structures — throughout the state do not meet earthquake standards. Many of these buildings will collapse like a house of cards if they are in the immediate area of a quake.\r\nAs usual, the state is between a rock and a hard place. If schools use their budgets to reinforce their buildings, they will have little money for teachers. Classes will be discontinued. Everyone’s priority, of course, is to keep the schools open.\r\n\"All we’re doing is crossing our fingers,\" said a state legislator. \"But that’s exactly what they did in Louisiana. They could have fixed the levee system for about $10 billion. But they didn’t; they just crossed their fingers. Now it’s now going to cost $100 billion to rebuild New Orleans. Here in California, we’re saying that we can’t afford the $10 billion. But where are we going to get the $100 billion to rebuild everything afterward? People never learn. They always close the barn door after the horse escapes.\"",
  "A women’s activist group based in Fresno said it is probably not going to protest as it had planned. The group, called \"Boobs, not Bombs,\" occasionally rallies throughout the state to protest such things as environmental destruction, equal rights for women, and an end to the war. To get media attention, they usually remove their blouses and bras.\r\n\"We didn’t do that originally,\" said Diane Boxer, \"but we never got any media coverage either. As soon as we took our tops off, we got nationwide coverage. All of a sudden we were on the six and eleven o’clock news. Unfortunately, it just shows the shallowness of men, who run all the media nationwide. We are concerned with issues, and they are concerned with tissue. But nowadays, even the wrong media coverage is better than no coverage.\" \r\nAbout 20 members of the group had planned to protest the governor’s speech today. He is trying to drum up support for his proposition requiring school teachers to pay for their students’ books. But when Gov. Arnold heard about the protest, he called the state’s attorney general. The governor knew that no one would pay attention to his speech if there were topless women nearby. \r\nThe attorney general told the group that their \"display\" would cause multiple auto crashes and corrupt innocent, wide-eyed children. He said that if they dared to go topless, they would be hauled off to jail.\r\n\"We have held fifteen protests statewide and have yet to cause one accident or corrupt one innocent child,\" scoffed Boxer.\r\n\"These are wonderful ladies, but they do not understand. Some day they will understand,\" said Gov. Arnold. \"Everything I do, I do for the people.\"",
  "Because of alleged widespread voting fraud, Arizona has become the first state in the union to require that voters show proof of U.S. citizenship. To register (or reregister) to vote, Arizona residents must now show a birth certificate or passport. Reregistration is required whenever a resident changes addresses. This requirement will cause problems for citizens who have lost their birth certificate or who don’t have a passport.\r\n\"These problems will be settled in time,\" said Barney Fife, an election official. \"Our priority is to prevent noncitizens from voting. Over 3,000 immigrants voted — illegally — in the last governor’s election. Voting is a vital right that belongs to citizens exclusively, not to every Tom, Dick, and Harry that has just immigrated to this country.\" \r\nCritics of the new law say that it will disenfranchise thousands of legitimate voters. Mrs. Thelma May agrees. She just moved to Tucson from Phoenix. She has to reregister now in order to vote, but has no birth certificate or passport.\r\n\"I’ve been voting all my life,\" she said. \"I voted for JFK in ’60. But I’m on my third marriage — I do hope it’s my last — which means that my last name has changed three times. The Biloxi hospital I was born in was destroyed by hurricane Camille in 1969. All its records — including my birth certificate — ended up in the Gulf. My only copy of my birth certificate was lost when my drunken first husband fell asleep on the sofa smoking a cigarette. The entire house burnt down. I’ve lived in Arizona for the past 25 years.",
  "A 20-year-old man, driving under the influence and at excessive speed early yesterday evening along New York Drive, died after clipping another car. Buddy Allen was dead at the scene of the accident. Apparently, he was not strapped into his seat belt at the time he collided with a car in front of him.\r\nAllen was doing about 60 mph on the 35 mph street when his SUV overtook and hit a car driven by Steve Frohman. Frohman, a scratch golfer, had just finished an unpleasant round of golf — he had lost $20 on the 18th hole. He said he was doing the speed limit when he happened to look in his rearview mirror and saw an SUV coming up on him fast.\r\nCertain that he was about to get rear-ended, Frohman managed to get halfway into the adjoining lane. The speeding SUV hit Frohman’s new sedan, then hit a curb, and became airborne. Allen flew out of his SUV, landing on grass near the base of a light pole. Frohman, braking to a stop, saw Allen land on the grass. But the unthinkable happened. Upside down but also flying through the air, the SUV struck the light pole and dropped straight down, landing squarely on Allen.\n\r\nFrohman ran over to the SUV. He could see both of Allen’s feet. Frohman tried to rock the SUV back and forth so that it would roll off Allen. Not succeeding, he dialed 911 on his cell phone. Police and paramedics arrived within a few minutes. Frohman was still trying to roll the SUV off the victim when they arrived. The police told him to move back. Four of them rolled the SUV off Allen. The paramedics did not even check for a pulse; they knew a dead person when they saw one.\r\nOne of the police officers congratulated Frohman on his attempt to save Allen.\r\n\"I wasn’t trying to save him,\" said Frohman.",
  "A drunk driver speeding along in his SUV on the 60 freeway last night killed three of four people in a sedan. The sedan had slowed to a crawl because of construction work on the 60. Four lanes were merged into two. The Department of Transportation crew was making repairs to a three-mile stretch of highway. Hundreds of bright orange traffic cones guided the merger. Four heavy-duty trucks were parked in the emergency lanes. Their brightly glowing signs said, \"Slow. Be prepared to stop. Construction ahead.\" Vehicle traffic had slowed to about 3 mph.\r\nMissing all of these warnings, the drunk driver, going at least 50 mph, plowed into the sedan. The sedan driver, a computer programmer, was a recent immigrant to America. In the passenger seat was his wife, and in the back seat were his 6-year-old daughter and his 8-year-old son. It was 9 p.m. The family had been at a restaurant to celebrate the little girl’s birthday. They never knew what hit them.\r\nThe impact of the collision caused the sedan to explode in flames. Somehow, the sedan driver managed to crawl out of the car seconds after the explosion. Third-degree burns covered much of his body. His chances for survival are slim. His life, as he knew it, is over. His loved ones were burned beyond recognition. The car was a skeleton of metal.\r\nThe 28-year-old drunk was not only unhurt, but was able to escape from his smoldering SUV and run away, leaving two whiskey bottles behind. The police tracked him down this morning. He claimed that his brakes had failed. A police spokesperson revealed that he has four prior convictions for driving under the influence.",
  "According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 39 percent of people who live in California do not speak English at home. In Las Casas, a city in southern California, 79 percent of residents speak little or no English at home or at work. To combat this problem, Las Casas is instituting a program called \"Love My English.\" Program funding will come from government grants and corporate donations.\r\nThe program has two goals. One is to improve residents’ English so that they can get better jobs. The other is to provide more qualified workers for corporations throughout the county.\r\n\"We are desperate for good workers who speak English,\" said Sydney Rove of Containers, Ltd. \"We have nationwide truck routes for good drivers, and we need salespeople in almost every state.\" \r\n\"We want everyone in Las Casas to speak English,\" said Ivan Libby, administrator of the school district. \"They don’t have to speak fluent English, of course, just survival English — how to give and get directions, order food, visit the doctor, read labels on food and medicines — the basic stuff. Once they’re able to read and write more English, they’ll be able to get better work and they’ll be more confident. We hope this confidence will inspire some of them to go on to get their high school diploma and perhaps even get a degree from a community college or a university.\" \r\nCurrently, most Las Casas residents qualify for only low-paying jobs. In fact, the pay is often so low that residents need to work two jobs to make ends meet. This program will help them get better-paying jobs not only in California but also nationwide. The district will mount a huge advertising campaign to alert residents to the free program. \"Love My English\" will be offered at various sites and times to reach as many residents as possible.",
  "Charles, a 29-year-old painter, tried to beat an 83-car freight train across the railroad tracks yesterday and lost. Fortunately for Charles and his two friends, the train hit the bed of his pickup truck. The force of the impact separated the rear of the truck from the front. The rear end of the pickup flew about 200 feet west of the front end. The train was traveling at 50 miles an hour through an industrial district. It was fully loaded with appliances and new vehicles from the east coast. There were no mechanical arms or flashing lights at the railroad crossing — only a stop sign on either side of the two-lane road.\r\nThe accident occurred at 4:30 p.m. on a sunny afternoon. Charles and his two co-workers had stopped at a neighborhood liquor store at about 3:45. There they had bought a case of bottled beer that was on sale for $9.95. By the time they got to the railroad crossing, they were all feeling good. They saw the train coming, and they heard the horn blowing.\r\nWhen the police arrived, all three friends were sitting on the ground under a shade tree about 50 feet from the front end of the truck. None of them were even scratched. The train and crew suffered no damage or injuries.\r\n\"I was going to stop,\" said Charles. \"But Tommy told me that the train wasn’t even close. He said that if he was driving, he could drive over the tracks, make a U-turn, drive over the tracks again, and then drink a whole beer before the train arrived.\" \r\nThe engineer just shook his head. \r\n\"They think it’s exciting, but it’s just stupid,\" the engineer said. \"These guys might be in jail for a little while. But I guarantee you, within a year they’ll be out drinking and driving and racing trains again.\" \r\nThe police charged Charles with driving under the influence, running a stop sign, causing an accident, reckless endangerment, and littering — broken beer bottles were all over the place. They charged his two friends with drinking in a moving vehicle and littering.\r\nA city official said there are no plans to install flashing lights and mechanical arms at the crossing, partly because not enough accidents occur there and partly because the city does not have sufficient funds to pay for such safety equipment.",
  "A group of parents is suing the Clover Area School District after it added \"intelligent design\" to the curriculum presented to high school biology students. Intelligent design, the parents argue, is false science. It is simply a clever phrase for creationism. Creationism is based on the Book of Genesis in the Bible. It is the belief that, in six days, God created the universe and all its creatures, including Adam and Eve, the first humans.\r\nSchool district officials believe that evolution is merely a theory, and a flawed one at that. They argue that, if students taking biology must learn about evolution, these students must also learn about intelligent design.\r\n\"There are two sides to every story,\" said Daryl Scopes, a district official. \"Darwin’s theory of evolution is just that — a theory. Not one scientist has ever proved that it is valid. The whole idea is absurd. Darwin wants us to believe that all Earth’s animals, from ants to elephants, have one common ancestor — the sponge! How ridiculous is that?! Who would worship a sponge?! We decided that our students must be aware of the true facts, as described in Genesis. God created the first man — Adam — in His own image. From one of Adam’s ribs, God then created Eve. God put Adam and Eve in charge of the Earth and all its creatures. Adam and Eve were perfect humans. But then they listened to the evil serpent and ate the forbidden fruit, and life for them — and us, their children — has been far from perfect ever since. That’s a beautiful story that we all learned as children. But, even more important, it’s a completely true story.\"",
  "A zoo employee was bitten by an African puff adder, a large poisonous snake. He was trying to put the snake into a bag so that it could be moved to a new snake house. The snake handler was wearing heavy gloves and thick boots, but the adder sank its fangs into the man’s neck. The handler squeezed the snake’s neck tightly, forcing the snake to withdraw its fangs. He then put the snake into the bag and tied the bag.\r\nHe called 911 to report that he had been bitten by the adder. When paramedics arrived at the new snake house, neither snake nor man was there. The paramedics started walking back toward the old snake house. A few moments later, they found the handler lying unconscious on a pathway. Curiously, the bag with the snake still in it was covering the man’s head and part of his chest.\r\nThe paramedics handed the bag to another zoo employee, who delivered the snake to its new home. They then transported the handler to the city hospital. Later, a hospital spokesman said that the handler was in good condition. He said that viper bites can cause a lot of tissue damage in the immediate area of the bite if not treated properly and quickly, but it looked like this victim would recover completely.\r\nThe zoo director said that this particular adder had a nasty reputation. This was the third time in six years that it had managed to bite someone. Fortunately, the previous two victims also recovered fully. In the future, the director joked, they might call the bomb disposal unit to handle the snake.",
  "The pounding was driving Edward crazy. A new neighbor had just moved into the apartment below him. The newcomer was deaf, or seemed to be, because he played his stereo loud enough for the whole building to hear.\r\nEdward went downstairs and politely told the newcomer that his stereo was too loud. He asked the new tenant to turn the volume down and keep it down as long as he lived in the building. The tenant appeared surprised and embarrassed, and said, \"Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it was that loud.\" \r\nEdward returned upstairs, feeling good, because he had taken a stand and politely let the newcomer know that loud music was not going to be tolerated. The next day all was quiet, and Edward continued to be pleased with himself. The following day, Edward thought it must be the Fourth of July, because it sounded like a marching band was playing on his street. Of course, it wasn’t the Fourth of July, and it wasn’t a marching band. It was the new neighbor, who was playing his music loud again.\r\nEdward was not one to repeat himself, feeling that each time he did, he merely diminished the value of his words. So, he did what he always did with offensive neighbors — namely, grin and bear it. Eventually, they would move away. Or he would.\r\nIn Los Angeles that summer, a woman had complained to her upstairs neighbor that he was playing his drums too loud and too often. The drummer repeatedly ignored her. He told her to stop whining. One day the woman walked upstairs and shot the drummer in the head. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\r\nThe drummer won’t bother anyone anymore with his drums, but the woman probably wishes that she hadn’t used her gun. There aren’t many things worse than living in prison. Instead of using a gun, she could have moved to another apartment, or even to another building. For the next 20 years, the only place she’ll be moving is to the bottom bunk or the top bunk.",
  "It was Perry’s 32nd birthday. His wife, Amanda, had promised him something special. Perry couldn’t imagine what it might be. He already had everything he needed or wanted. Whatever she was going to give him, it was definitely going to be a surprise. She had not asked him whether he wanted anything, and he had not dropped any hints suggesting that he was hoping for something. In fact, his plan was simply to watch TV and ignore the event. There was certainly nothing interesting or exciting about turning 32.\r\nWhen he got home from work, he changed into his shorts and a T-shirt and took their dog Pretty Boy for a walk. When he returned, Amanda had also gotten home from work. She gave him a kiss and told him happy birthday. He thanked her and asked what the surprise was. She told him that it was on the pillow in the bedroom. He went into the bedroom and found a brightly wrapped package with a big blue bow on it. He brought it out to the living room.\r\n\"Why don’t you try to guess what it is?\" Amanda suggested.\r\n\"Okay,\" Perry replied. \"It’s not a motorcycle or a houseboat. It’s not my Christmas bonus. It’s not another pet; I don’t see any air holes in the wrapping and I don’t hear any sounds.\" \r\n\"Well, maybe it’s a turtle,\" Amanda smiled.\r\n\"Yes, that would explain the silence, but turtles still need to breathe,\" Perry said. \"It’s not a book or a video or a CD, is it?\"\r\n\"No, you’re not even close. Remember, it’s something special.\" \r\n\"Well, you’ve got me,\" Perry said, puzzled. Something special in a box that was only about one cubic foot. He told Amanda that he gave up. She told him to unwrap the box. After opening it, all he found was a little rubber doll.\r\n\"What’s this?\" he asked.\r\n\"It’s our first baby, silly. I’m pregnant!\" Amanda beamed.",
  "It was, as usual, a hot and sunny July 4 — Independence Day. Eight-year-old Jeffrey was excited about the annual parade. He wanted to see everything, and he wanted to see it now. But the parade wouldn’t start until 10 o’clock. His mom Julia tried to keep Jeffrey in check. She made him clean his room and take the dog for a walk. When he finished those chores, she walked with him to the parade route, which extended about two miles along Sierra Madre Boulevard.\r\nThe parade, as usual, was wonderful. It started with the high school band and a marching drum band. Then followed about a dozen government dignitaries in convertibles, smiling and waving at the people they were usually lying to. After that, there were clowns, jugglers, exotic cars, racing cars, and classic cars. Interwoven among the cars were Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, students representing various elementary schools, the local mountain rescue squad, and local realtors throwing out free candy with their business cards attached.\r\nThree bands played music from their rolling truck beds. The parade contained more than 500 participants and lasted two hours. Flags, balloons, and trash receptacles were everywhere. The sidewalks were full of spectators. Leashed to their owners, about 200 dogs also attended the parade, most of them sniffing, barking at, and playing with one another.\r\nThe final part of the parade was the fire trucks, blowing their horns and spraying all the kids who ran out into the street yelling and laughing. Jeffrey ran out with about 20 other kids and got totally wet. His shirt clung to his body. Water was squishing out of his shoes when he finally came back to the sidewalk. A huge smile was on his face.\r\n\"That was great, Mom!\" he exclaimed. \"Did you see that? When I grow up, I’m going to be a fireman.\"",

  "Chris loved to shop at thrift stores. Almost a month ago, he bought a popular word game that uses little chips of wood with different letters on them. As he was purchasing it, the clerk said, \"Oh, look, the game box hasn’t even been opened yet! That might be worth some money.\" \r\nChris examined the box, and, sure enough, it was completely enveloped in factory-sealed plastic. When he looked at the box cover, he saw that beneath the name of the game and the description was a copyright date of 1973.\r\n\"You should put that up for auction on the Internet, and see what happens,\" the clerk said.\r\n\"Yes, you’re right,\" Chris agreed. \"I think I’ll give that a try. The rarity of something is part of what increases its value, and I can’t imagine there being very many unopened boxes of this game still around 30 years later. Maybe it’s worth millions!\"\r\n\"Well, if it is, don’t forget who told you about the wrapper,\" the clerk smiled.\r\n\"No problem. You’re getting a percentage of anything over $10,\" Chris said. The game itself was priced at only $1.99, and the clerk gave Chris the usual 10-percent senior discount.\r\n\"You’ve got yourself a deal, partner,\" she replied, laughing.\r\nAt home, Chris went online to several auction sites looking for his game. He couldn’t find it anywhere on the auction sites. Then he typed in the name of the word game and hit Search. The response was 5,543 sites containing that name or parts of it. Chris examined the first 10 sites and found a site that listed people looking for various versions of the game. \r\nOver the years, the game had been produced using different chip sizes, colors, materials, and even fonts. In addition, different game boards were produced over the years, themselves consisting of different colors and fonts. The game board had never changed in size or material. Most of the game seekers seemed content with used games. Only a few even mentioned \"fresh,\" unopened games. Those who wanted unopened games all promised top dollar. Chris emailed all of them, telling them what he had.\r\nTwo weeks later, Chris went back to the thrift shop. He said to the clerk, \"How are you doing, partner?\"\r\nShe looked at him for a second, then recognized him and said, \"Oh, hi, partner!\"\r\n\"I’ve got something for you,\" he beamed. \"I’m sorry it didn’t turn out to be millions.

  "Her plane had just landed in Cityville. Inside the airport, Patricia went over to Acme Car Rental and asked for the cheapest car available. She needed a car for 48 hours. Because it was the weekend, there was only one car available — an SUV. Patricia was an environmentalist. SUVs, which are big cars consuming a lot of gasoline, offended her greatly.\r\nBut she needed something to get to Baker, a town that was 100 miles from the small airport. So she went to RentMe instead. \"I need a car for 48 hours,\" she said, \"and I don’t want an SUV. I want something small and cheap.\" They told her they had just the vehicle for her, a 1998 Fiat. It was only thirty dollars a day, including insurance and other incidental fees. All she had to do was pay for her own gasoline. Patricia was very pleased. Thirty dollars a day was a good rate even for a weekday. She signed all the paperwork, and they gave her the keys.\r\nThe Fiat was a 4-speed, 4-cylinder, 2-door beauty. The paint, tires, and interior were like new. It was comfortable, even though the air-conditioner was not the frostiest. She got in and drove north. It was a two-lane road all the way to Baker, with only one town between the airport and Baker. That town was Norris, 40 miles from Baker.\r\nPatricia didn’t make it to Norris. The car refused to run 30 minutes after she had been driving it. Fortunately, her cell phone was able to connect back to the RentMe desk. \"My car stopped running, and I’m out here in the middle of nowhere in the hot sun!\" she said.\r\n\"That doesn’t make any sense,\" said the clerk. \"You did put gas in the car before you left town, didn’t you?\"\r\n\"No, of course not!\" yelled Patricia. \"Why would I put gas in the car before I even got out of town?\"\r\n\"Well, why do you think you got such a good rate? We save money by having the customer gas up instead of us having to put gas in the car.\" \r\n\"I was in a hurry,\" said Patricia.\r\n\"Well, sometimes you pay a price for being in a hurry,\" said the clerk. \"We’ll send a man out with some spare gas for you, if you’d like.\" \r\n\"Of course I’d like,\" said Patricia. \"How long will it be?\"\r\nThe clerk told her it would be within the hour.

  "The old house was sold. A new house was yet to be purchased, so Randy was going to rent for a while. He was moving from Virginia to California. The move would put some memories behind him. He was looking forward to a fresh start.\r\nRandy and Nora had gotten married six years ago. It was the first marriage for both of them. Eight months after the marriage, Nora found out she was pregnant. That was good. When she started getting stomachaches, they figured it was the new baby. But then she miscarried.\r\nThe stomachaches, however, continued. In fact, they got worse. It wasn’t a simple stomachache. It was liver cancer. Then it was stomach cancer, lymph gland cancer, breast cancer, and brain cancer. It never stopped spreading. There was little hope, but Nora battled the daily pain with smiles and few complaints.\r\nAfter five years of doctors, hospitals, chemotherapy, and surgery, Nora lost the battle. More than one million dollars was spent on medical bills, more than ten thousand prayers were said by family and friends — all to no avail. The only time that Randy asked the doctor for his honest opinion, the doctor said, \"She might have six months.\" Nora died seven days later. Just before she died, she silently squeezed Randy’s hand.\r\nThe mover took six hours longer to load the moving van than he had estimated originally. Randy wondered how much extra this was going to cost him. After the mover and his crew had departed for California, Randy noticed a 3-foot-long scar in his new hardwood floor. It looked like the crew had dragged his heavy metal bed frame. Randy hoped the new homeowner wouldn’t complain about it too much. He wondered how many damaged goods were in the moving van.\r\nThe phone rang. It was the California-bound car transporter. He told Randy that his truck was in Alexandria at Fifth and Main, and he would wait for Randy there. Randy walked out to his car. In five minutes, he was at Fifth and Main. He gave the transporter the ignition key and watched him drive his car up the ramp onto the truck. There were five other cars already on the truck. The transporter said, \"I’ll call you in nine days,\" and drove off. Randy hailed a cab.\r\nEleven days later in Santa Monica, Randy got the call. The transporter said he would be there in three hours. Five hours later, the transporter arrived. Randy watched as the transporter backed his car down the ramp. The car was filthy. The transporter explained that bad weather had slowed him down — tornadoes, rain, and dust storms. No locusts?, Randy wondered.\r\nRandy drove his car to the carwash. While sitting in a chair waiting for the car to be finished, he saw a pretty young woman waiting with her boyfriend. They were talking and laughing. Then they stood up. They kissed, and she went across the street. Watching her, Randy thought about Nora squeezing his hand.",
  "Erin and her best friend Amy flew into San Diego last week. They are both in their mid-20s, and both are nurses who live in Georgia. It was their first visit to California, and they were excited.\r\nThey visited San Diego’s world-famous zoo and fell in love with the giant pandas. \"They are so cute,\" Erin said. Then they drove north to La Jolla so that they could glide off the cliffs 100 feet above the beach. That was scary, exciting, fun, and expensive. They went to a local beach to get a peek at nudists, but no one was there. \"That was a major disappointment,\" Erin joked.\r\nAfter shopping in La Jolla, they headed north to Los Angeles. They saw the Hollywood sign and visited many places in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. They hoped they would see lots of actors and actors’ homes. If they got lucky, they would get some autographs and maybe even some photographs of them standing next to a movie star.\r\nBut they were disappointed. A minivan took them on a tour past actors’ homes, but no actors were outside their homes. The homes themselves were barely visible. They were often hidden by tall gates, fences, walls, hedges, or trees. Later, however, Erin and Amy were able to put their hands and feet into the handprints and footprints of movie stars at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.\r\nThey went to Venice boardwalk just south of the Santa Monica pier, because the boardwalk is famous for its muscle beach, weird characters, and paddle tennis. The boardwalk is one of the best places in California for people-watching. The girls enjoyed talking to the colorful locals. They were also surprised at how many people they talked to were Europeans visiting California.\r\nAfter Venice, they went sunbathing on the beach just north of the Venice pier. They even got to hang out with some real California surfers. The surfers tried to teach them how to ride a board in the water. That was difficult but fun. They took plenty of pictures to show their friends back home.\r\nErin and Amy drove to Burbank the next day to watch the taping of a Jay Leno show, but the line was so long that they decided to pass on it. Instead they went to a mall and had a great time shopping. They flew back to Georgia with souvenirs, photos, and wonderful memories.",
  "The seal population just south of Monterey, California, is making life difficult for the surfer population. There have been several incidents in the past month of surfers being bitten or attacked by seals. Scientists think it is merely a result of overcrowding. Over the past 10 years, the seals have made \"their\" beach bigger to suit their growing population.\r\nThe seal-loving activists say that the surfers should surf elsewhere. They say that the surfers are infringing on the seals’ territory and making them nervous and irritable. Sometimes, when there are too many surfers, they actually cause the seals to leave the beach. This, the activists say, deprives nature lovers of the opportunity to enjoy watching and listening to the seals. The activists argue that this area should be off limits to surfers.\r\nSurfers, of course, don’t see it quite that way. They think that it’s good if the seals get hit in the head with a loose surfboard occasionally, because that will teach them to stay on their rocks and stay away from the surfers’ part of the beach.\r\n\"They shouldn’t be allowed to have their rocks and our beach, too,\" exclaimed one blond, tan, thin 16-year-old who refused to identify himself. \"All these seals think about is me, me, me! They need to learn to share. Can’t someone just train them to clear out of here from about 1:00 to sunset? They could come back here and stay all night and all morning. That makes sense to me.\" \r\nThe park service is going to hold a public hearing on the issue. They know it’s going to be a tough issue to settle, because neither the activists nor the surfers seem willing to compromise. A similar issue in San Diego was settled in the seals’ favor. Surfers were prohibited from using the seals’ area. Mysteriously, the seals eventually vacated that particular area, and the surfers were allowed to return.",
  "Catherine invited Nelson to dinner. The previous semester, she had been a student in Nelson’s grammar class, but she had to drop the class because her son Kendall was having a problem in school. The problem was that he wasn’t studying. Catherine had decided that Kendall needed more motivation. She provided that motivation by watching him like a hawk. She also restricted his use of his Game Boy. He was allowed to play the computer game only on weekends.\r\nNelson was getting to be an old man. He had been teaching various subjects for over 30 years. He could have retired several years ago, but he loved teaching. He said his students gave him something to look forward to every day. He said he planned to teach until he dropped dead in the classroom.\r\nNelson accepted Catherine’s invitation. He decided to take a little gift to Catherine to show his gratitude for the invitation. But he couldn’t think of what would be appropriate. Opening his kitchen cabinet, he found the perfect gift — an unopened box of tea. In a kitchen drawer, he found some fresh-looking wrapping paper. He wrapped up the box of tea expertly. \r\nFriday evening, he drove over to Catherine’s and rang the doorbell. Once inside, he presented his gift. Catherine made a funny face. She said she loved the wrapping paper. Then she unwrapped the tea and made another funny face. She said, \"Nelson, I gave this tea to you when I dropped out last semester, and I wrapped it in this paper!\"\r\nNelson gulped. His face turned a little red. He told himself he had better remember to actually buy gifts in the future. He apologized to Catherine. She smiled and said, \"It’s okay.",
  "Chad had worked hard all his young life, and then his father died. Unknown to Chad and almost everyone else, his father was a very rich man who hadn’t lived like one. The will disclosed an astounding amount of money his father had accumulated during his lifetime. Chad, the sole survivor, was now rich beyond his wildest dreams. It was as if he had won the state lottery.\r\nSo, there was only one thing to do. Ever since he was a little boy living in a 19-foot trailer, Chad had dreamed of living in a big house with a big yard and a big dog. Well, now the dream would come true.\r\nChad called up several Realtors and invited each to his tiny apartment so that he could tell them about his dream. The first three Realtors pretended to believe that Chad could afford the type of house he described to them. They all said they would get back to him. They didn’t. Two weeks after talking to the third Realtor, Chad met and talked to a pretty, female Realtor. She said she would find him one of the best and biggest houses in the state.\r\nA month later, she called to tell him that she was going to pick him up and drive him to his dream house. When they got there, it was even better than Chad had imagined. It was a three-story, 42,000-square-foot behemoth.\r\nThere was a two-lane, mile-long \"driveway.\" There was a 10-car garage. The mansion had porches, balconies, fireplaces, gardens, and all kinds of trees. It had a heated swimming pool, a lighted tennis court, a gymnasium, a bowling alley, a theater, a music room, and a ballroom.\r\nIt had four master suites, each containing a huge bedroom, two bathrooms, a living room, kitchen, and dining room. Each suite had its own temperature controls. There were two staircases and three elevators in the house, each elevator big enough to hold a grand piano. The main kitchen had five refrigerator-freezers lined up side by side. The formal dining room seated 60. Next to it were a menu-planning room and a silverware room. In the basement was a huge wine cellar.\r\nThe living room easily had space for eight or nine sofas and as many coffee tables. The library, next to the reading room, had enough shelving for almost 10,000 books. The property also had two guest houses. It had everything except a big dog.\r\nChad took it. A month later he bought four Great Dane puppies, and a year later he married his Realtor.",
  "Alvin was walking down 6th Street on a hot sunny day when he saw smoke coming out of the street. He could smell the smoke, and it was getting thicker. It was coming out of a storm drain. Alvin used his cell phone to call the fire department.\r\n\"The storm drain is on fire!\" he said. The fire department asked for his whereabouts and he said he was near 6th and Main. They said they’d be right there to investigate the situation. Alvin didn’t have to be anywhere, so he waited for the firemen to arrive. He was curious himself as to what could possibly be burning beneath the street. As far as he knew, there wasn’t anything beneath the street except concrete. And everyone knows that concrete doesn’t burn.\r\nA fire truck arrived a few minutes later. \"Are you the man who called?\" asked the driver. Alvin said yes. By now Alvin could hear crackling sounds, like wood burning. The firemen didn’t seem to consider it an emergency.\r\n\"What do you think it could be?\" Alvin asked the driver.\r\n\"Oh, we know what it is. We have to take care of a problem like this every few months. It’s the homeless people in their ’houses.’\"\r\nHomeless people have been living under the streets for years. Using their knowledge of the storm drain system, they set up their own \"bunkers\" beneath the streets. These living areas frequently contain tables, mattresses, chairs, and sofas. The residents often \"borrow\" electricity by connecting to a live wire above-ground to power their own lamps and even TVs underground. Either this borrowed electricity or a discarded cigarette causes an occasional fire.\r\nAlvin watched as a couple of firemen lifted a manhole cover and descended beneath the street with a fire hose. A few minutes later, the black smoke turned white. Shortly afterward, the firemen reappeared with a homeless person who seemed to have just been woken up.",
  "Have you ever been bitten? Of course you have. We are all surrounded by creatures that might, or do, bite. (Such creatures include angry humans!) Day or night, you might be a victim. Even as you dream peacefully with your head on your pillow, bedbugs might be nibbling away at you. During the day, they relax inside pillows and mattresses, waiting for your evening arrival so they can enjoy their nocturnal bedtime snack — which is you! But bedbugs don’t kill people. An insect that does kill people is the mosquito, the deadliest insect in the world. Its malarial bite kills a couple of million people every year. Other insects, like bees and wasps, kill about 60 people in the United States every year.\r\nWalk outside and you are a target for \"man’s best friend.\" Dogs bite about four million Americans every year. About 100 dog-bite victims visit U.S. emergency rooms every day. Many bites are terrible. A vicious attack on a young woman in France led to the first face transplant. To avoid the dogs near or on the sidewalks in your neighborhood, you might want to hike into the desert or the woods. There, you run the risk of bites from rattlesnakes, scorpions, and blood-sucking ticks. Not to mention the occasional bear, wolf, or mountain lion. \r\nSafely back at home, watch where you go in your house or garage. Shy but deadly, the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider make themselves comfortable in quiet areas of your closets or garage. One bite from either of them can make you very sick; about six Americans die every year from such bites. \r\nAnother bite to worry about is a rabid animal bite. Any warm-blooded animal can get infected with rabies. Rabies is a virus, like Ebola, but more of a killer than Ebola. Rabies kills about 50,000 people worldwide annually. In the U.S., about 20,000 people get treated for rabies annually, but only one or two persons die. Many people get rabies from their cats, which in turn got rabies from a wild animal. Make sure you take your pets to the vet to get rabies vaccinations.",
  "Hemp is a strong, cane-like plant known throughout the world for its durability and versatility. Hemp is used to make ropes, blankets, paper, and many other useful products. In the United States, however, the hemp industry and its supporters struggle for legitimacy. The U.S. government is concerned that hemp producers might grow hemp to sell as marijuana. Hemp, although a variety of the cannabis species, contains less than one percent of THC, which is the active ingredient of marijuana. To get high from hemp, a person would have to smoke about ten hemp cigarettes. \r\nAs a result of its concern, the U.S. government discourages the production and use of hemp and its products in America. Instead, it approves the destruction of millions of trees annually to produce newspapers and hundreds of other paper products that get thrown away every day. All those paper products can be made from hemp.\r\nHemp was discovered in Asia thousands of years ago. It is cultivated worldwide. Hemp can grow quickly to heights of 15 feet or more in many different climates and soils. It needs little care to achieve its full growth.\r\nHemp matures in one growing season. It’s used in many products, from paper to beauty products to clothing. Like bamboo, it is used in the construction industry. Hemp is healthful, too — its seeds produce a nutritious flour and oil.\r\nDespite all hemp’s beneficial — and non-drug — uses, the U.S. government continues to argue that the use of hemp might lead to increased use of marijuana. Marijuana, says the government, is the gateway drug to more dangerous drugs like cocaine and heroin. Apparently, the government believes that hemp could be the gateway drug (ten cigarettes to get high) to the gateway drug marijuana (one \"joint,\" or often less, to get high).\r\nWhile focused on the individual dangers and societal decay that might  result from ten hemp cigarettes, the U.S. government does little to prevent the thousands of deaths, injuries, and illnesses caused annually by tobacco and alcohol — two of the most addictive, dangerous, popular (and profitable) — drugs in the world. In fact, the government also does nothing to discourage gambling, as most states now have state lotteries, and many states have gambling casinos. All three industries contribute to the government’s bottom line. \r\nPerhaps hemp producers could win government support if they just focused on demonstrating how much money that hemp production, products, and sales could contribute to government coffers.",
  "The two-week vacation at the end of summer school ended Friday. Kevin had gone nowhere during his vacation. He had the money, but he hated to travel alone. He used to take vacations with Matt, his youngest brother, but they had a big argument at the end of their last vacation. Each of them had spent the last three years waiting for the other to apologize.\r\nKevin did not feel good about being on non-speaking terms with his favorite brother. But he was not going to ask for forgiveness when, in his mind, this whole misunderstanding was his brother’s fault.\r\nSo Kevin’s summer vacation was spent in his own \"back yard.\" As usual, he had planned to clean up his apartment. As usual, two weeks later his apartment looked just as it had two weeks before.\r\nHe did do one thing new and different during his vacation. He went to a new coffee shop, called Peet’s, on Foothill Boulevard. It served 25 varieties of delicious coffee at reasonable prices, and the staff were genuinely friendly.\r\nThe coffee shop had a do-it-yourself counter near the entrance. On the counter were lids, straws, and wooden stirrers. There were wraps to protect your hand from the hot coffee inside the cup. There were also individual servings of sugar, sweeteners, and creamers. Kevin used the lids and wraps, but drank his coffee black.\r\nThe shop was air-conditioned at a slightly chilly temperature. About eight small, round tables were inside. Outside were four bigger tables. Each had four white metal chairs around it, and several big umbrellas provided shade. Even on hot afternoons, there was usually a pleasant breeze.\r\nKevin visited the coffee shop four times during his vacation. He always sat at a table outside by himself and read the free daily paper. Each day he was there, he read most of the newspaper articles while he enjoyed two cups of coffee.\r\nBetween articles, he took breaks by watching the nearby traffic and pedestrians. The coffee shop was next to a huge parking lot. The lot was for customers of Ralphs, BlockBuster, Bank of America, Baja Fresh, See’s Candies, and several other stores. Kevin considered his outdoor seat the perfect place for one of his favorite activities — people-watching.\r\nThe coffee shop, with its excellent location and coffee, had helped make his vacation a pleasant one. But he knew in his heart, had his brother been there to join him just one day, his vacation would have been a perfect one.",
  "It was a summer day. Derek was wearing shorts, but no shirt. He was listening to the radio and using his computer. The TV was on, but the volume was muted. The fan was on medium speed, because low speed was too low for his hot apartment. He dared not use high speed, because loose papers on the tabletop would start flapping or flying everywhere. The fan was far enough away to barely stir the papers, but close enough to cool him off.\r\nSuddenly, Derek’s stomach growled loudly. He didn’t feel all that hungry, but he decided that the \"squeaky wheel\" should get some grease. He went over to the refrigerator. Absent-mindedly, he opened the freezer door. Inside the freezer were six empty ice cube trays.\r\nHe shut the freezer door and opened the refrigerator door. He scrutinized the shelves: milk, pickles, olives, butter, diet soda, an unopened jar of strawberry preserves that he must have bought two years ago, ketchup, mustard, three bottles of water, a few pieces of hard candy, and some single-wrap cheese slices. How could a whole refrigerator have nothing worth eating, Derek wondered. He opened the vegetable bins. Nothing was in there except some red onions, half a head of green cabbage, and two apples that had soft, brown spots.\r\nHis refrigerator contained some food, but it was food that didn’t look the least bit appetizing. Only if he were really starving would he eat any of it. He thought of the C-rations he used to eat in the army. Only when he was almost starving did he open his C-rations. Then he wolfed all the food down and enjoyed a smoke afterwards. \r\nDerek went back to his desk and resumed using his computer and listening to the radio. His stomach growled again, but he ignored it. He decided to wait until he was really hungry. Then he would walk down to the fried chicken place five minutes away and get some food that was finger-licking good. But no cigarette for \"dessert.\"",
  "Researchers are discovering more and more about the inner workings of the brain through MRI and PET scans. Both scans produce images of active, inactive, healthy, and unhealthy areas of the brain.\r\nThese images are helping doctors treat brain dysfunction. In the United States, drugs have been the most common treatment for people with brain dysfunction. While even better drugs continue to be developed, drug-free remedies are now thought to be possible because of new research with DNA and stem cells.\r\nBut some scientists think that even these remedies might be unnecessary. They think that many people with brain dysfunction can fix themselves by simply \"training\" their brains. Computer software is helping people with Alzheimer’s practice repetitive memory games. These games improve their memory enough that some become functional again.\r\nOther brain disorders may also be treatable by using repetitive exercises. Born with cerebral palsy, Sara had a useless right arm. Researchers immobilized her good left arm, thus forcing the 5-year-old to use only her right arm for a few hours a day. In less than a year, Sara’s right arm became functional.\r\n\"It sounds almost too simple and too obvious,\" said one researcher. \"For years, people have used repetitive training to become better at games, sports, and other activities. Why has it taken us this long to realize that we can also train the brain? Simple repetitive practice may restore normal brain function for many patients of all ages.\"",
  "If you could combine 100 of the best minds in the history of mankind into one super-brain, would that super-brain be able to fully know and appreciate all the wonders of the universe? Probably not. The universe is simply too big, too wondrous, too fantastic for even a super-human to know and to appreciate. \r\nImagine an ant crawling all over an elephant. That ant has little or no idea of what that elephant is all about. Imagine a tiny fish swimming next to a giant blue whale. That fish has little or no idea of how complex and magnificent that blue whale is. Similarly, we humans do not know, nor will we ever know, all the wonders of our universe. It’s just too big, and our minds are just too small.\r\nFor example, many of us take the sun for granted; sometimes we even complain about it! How many of us marvel at it, wondering about its seemingly infinite power and energy? Yet the sun is but one of uncountable billions of stars in the universe. And each is remarkable in many ways, and in its own way. \r\nJust as there are billions of different heavenly bodies, there are billions of different earthly bodies. Look at all the variety we have here just on our planet. We have seven billion people, and they all look different! How can that be? So many cats and dogs and cows look alike, yet it’s rare that we find two people who look exactly like each other. Look at all the different birds and fish we have, the different two-legged, four-legged, six-legged, and eight-legged (and more legged!) animals we have, and all the different and beautiful plants. And all of these creatures are doing their own thing. What a marvelous world we live in. Yet, if you point out how fantastic a plant or an animal or even a rock is to someone, how often will that person respond by saying, \"So?\"  \r\nSadly, too many of us are too busy with our \"ant\" lives to appreciate the elephant, or too busy with our \"fish\" lives to wonder at the blue whale. Like the ants and the fish, we all have our jobs to do, and if we don’t do them, our existence and our survival are threatened. So, many of us have to ignore the wonders that Mother Nature has presented us, as we focus on the hard work of just surviving. But even when we have free time, we continue to ignore the wonders of the world, instead focusing our attention on activities that relax and please us. \r\nIt seems that the only time we marvel at nature is when it gets angry and ugly. But even then, we still have no idea, and never will, of how angry and ugly nature can get.",
  "Gabriel was running late. He had a 2 o’clock appointment to give blood in the gymnasium of the Community Education Center on Foothill Boulevard. At least, he thought he had one; no one had ever called him back to confirm his reservation. Probably a confirmation call wasn’t even necessary, he thought.\r\nHe didn’t feel comfortable giving blood nowadays, no matter how much they talked about the unlikelihood of getting infections. As far as Gabriel was concerned, if anything involved humans, it also involved the possibility of human error. But he was willing to take the risk because he liked to think that this was his way of \"giving back\" to his community.\r\nWhen he started his car, he knew the gas station would be his first stop after the gym. He wouldn’t have time to gas up before his appointment, because long gas lines were a daily problem as people tried to beat the rising gas prices.\r\nGabriel parked his car and walked into the gym. No other donors were there. Six staff people, identified by their \"Give Life\" T-shirts, were inside the gym. He walked over to Andrew, the staff supervisor.\r\n\"I have an appointment at two o’clock to donate my blood,\" he said.\r\n\"Well, we’re ready if you are,\" said Andrew, smiling.\r\n\"I’m ready, willing, and able.\" \r\n\"Great! Just fill out this form.\" \r\nGabriel filled out the form in just a few minutes, and then gave it back to Andrew. Andrew gave the form to Alexis, who asked Gabriel to sit down at her table. She asked him if he liked the new forms. He asked what was new about them.\r\n\"I don’t have to ask you about 30 questions that I used to have to ask you, so they save both of us time.\" She asked Gabriel to hold out his hand.\r\n\"Which finger do you prefer?\" she asked, as she unwrapped the needle that she was going to prick his finger with to get a blood sample.\r\n\"Oh, it doesn’t matter. They’re all the same to me. Where is everybody? The last time I was here, the gym was full,\" Gabriel said.\r\n\"I don’t know. It’s not even 2:15 yet. I’m sure it will start to get busy shortly. We’re hoping that everyone shows up,\" Alexis said.\r\n\"Maybe you ought to give away free T-shirts to encourage a good turnout,\" Gabriel suggested.\r\n\"Or free gas to guarantee one,\" Alexis said, smiling.",
  "Brett was moving into his parents’ home. His mom had recently died of cancer, five years after his dad had died in his sleep. His sister had kept or sold all the furniture in their parents’ house, which was in the same town she lived in. She was upset that their parents had left the house solely to Brett. She had told Brett that he should do the right thing, and give her money for \"her\" half of the house. \r\nHe had hired two movers at $40 an hour. They worked hard and fast. Brett was impressed with how they had maneuvered their large truck into a tight loading area. Movers seemed to know lots of tricks — some good, some not so good.\r\nBrett was a bachelor, but in the last 30 years he had accumulated a lot of stuff in the various apartments he had lived in. The movers were there for the big stuff — the bed, chest of drawers with mirror, refrigerator, computer desk, coffee table, dining room table, TVs, stereo, sofa, and, of course, the books. Earlier, Brett had packed more than a thousand books into cardboard boxes and sturdy paper bags. More books than he would ever have time to read, unless scientists discovered a cure for the aging process. What a day that would be!\r\nThe movers were finished in only four hours. Brett gave them each a $10 tip. He wondered if that would be an insult or a compliment. They smiled and said thanks. (He would never know.) He told them he would meet them at the house in a few hours.\r\nThe apartment now looked a lot bigger, but there was still a lot of work to be done. All the big things were gone, but there were lots of smaller things. The kitchen cabinets were still full of dishes, plastic ware, and canned and packaged food. All the towels, bedding, and clothes were still in the bedroom and bathroom. In the living room and hall closet were his golf clubs, fishing rods, and toolboxes.\r\nHe was going to have to pack all this by himself and then make many car trips to his parents’ house. He had thought about asking his best friend for some help, but then decided against that. Jerome had helped Brett make his last two moves. A friend can ask just so many favors from a friend before a friend loses that friend, especially when it comes to helping a friend move or taking a friend to the airport. Brett decided, if worse came to worst, he’d just pack all the remaining things and then hire the movers again.\r\nHis phone rang. It was his sister. During a thunderstorm the previous evening, lightning had struck her house, starting a fire that burnt the house down before the fire department showed up. Luckily, she, her husband, their daughter, and their cat escaped unharmed. But they were going to need a place to live while their house was rebuilt.",
  "Blair needed a break from the indoor life. Sometimes it seemed like he was in his apartment 24/7. He had recently found a perfect outdoor cure. It was a new coffeehouse on Foothill Boulevard that served 45 kinds of coffee and tea. He liked it because the coffee was good and the place was never overcrowded.\r\nThe coffeehouse was only a 10-minute walk from his apartment. Blair took the walk. There were three female customers in the coffeehouse. None of them was young and pretty. Blair was a little disappointed. He preferred to see good-looking women while he was drinking good-tasting coffee.\r\nHe ordered a large \"coffee of the day,\" which was $1.70. He gave the clerk two dollars. He put the change in the tip jar and took his coffee outside. Blair preferred to drink outside. That way he could watch the traffic on the street. He liked to spot old Cadillacs that looked similar to his own.\r\nHe sat at a table under an umbrella, opened his book, and began reading. The book was a self-improvement book. Blair had been reading it on and off for about two years. He hadn’t noticed any improvement. A woman was approaching the patio. Blair looked up to see if she was attractive. She was. And she was by herself. He returned to the book as she passed by him. Blair kept looking at the pages, but his mind was on the woman.\r\nA few minutes later, she came outside holding a cup of coffee and sat at the table right next to Blair’s. Her chair was so close to his that he could have reached over and touched her on her right shoulder. There were four other empty tables on the patio. Why had she sat at this one, so close to him? Was she looking for a boyfriend? Was she hoping that he would say hello?\r\nBlair went back to his book. But he wasn’t reading the words — he was thinking about the woman. What could he say to her? How could he break the ice? What was a good line? \"What blend are you drinking?\" \"Your perfume smells nice.\" \"Weren’t we in the same art class?\"\r\nBut maybe she wasn’t interested in him at all. Maybe she just wanted to sit and drink in peace. Yet why would she sit so close to him? His thoughts were whirling around. He finally hit upon The Right Approach. As soon as she finished her drink, he’d ask her if he could treat her to another one. That would be a nice gesture on his part, and if she said No, then no harm, no foul. He’d go back to his book — but at a different table.\r\nJust then, her cell phone rang. She answered it, then laughed, then started talking animatedly. That’s got to be her boyfriend, Blair thought.\r\nBut from the moment she had answered the phone, it didn’t matter to Blair if she had a boyfriend or not, because she was speaking another language. Blair was not interested in a girl who didn’t speak English. He went back to his book and his coffee. It tasted good, and his mind was clear.",
  "Holding his open-face motorcycle helmet in his left hand, Jack told his friend, \"The party was good, but next time you’ve got to invite more women.\" \r\nHis friend said, \"Sure. Like it’s my job in life to set you up with women. Are you okay to drive? Every time I saw you, you had a beer in your hand. You can stay here tonight if you want.\" \r\nJack said, \"Thanks. I didn’t have that many beers. I paced myself. You’ve got to know your limit when you’re on a bike.\" \r\nHe said good night, put on his helmet, got on his motorcycle, and drove off. Traveling at about 60 mph on an unlit, two-lane road, he missed a curve and drove into an open concrete culvert. He lay next to his motorcycle for 20 minutes before a truck driver noticed the wreckage.\r\nA half hour later, Jack was lying on a gurney in the local hospital. Moaning in pain, he was unaware of his condition or whereabouts. The emergency room doctors gave him no medication — they needed to examine him thoroughly before taking him to surgery.\r\nHis jaw was broken, as were all three bones in his right leg. Part of his femur was protruding through his thigh, and there was a deep hole in his shin just below his knee. Dr. Kildare wanted to amputate Jack’s leg just below the knee. He said the hole in the shin was so deep that infection would be inevitable. He figured amputation then would be better than amputation later.\r\nDr. Welby disagreed. He said Jack was young enough to heal rapidly, with little possibility of significant infection. Since Dr. Welby was in charge, Jack was allowed to keep his leg. Dr. Kildare would just have to wait for another banged-up motorcycle rider.\r\nThe day following surgery, Jack achieved consciousness briefly in his hospital room. He didn’t notice that his leg was suspended and completely immobilized. He didn’t notice that there was an IV tube and needle taped into the back of each hand. He didn’t notice that his jaw was wired shut. All he noticed was that a beautiful young nurse was looking at him. He tried to introduce himself, but he had no idea what his name was. He went right back to sleep.",
  "It was a sunny, cool Christmas Day in Sheepshead Bay. Dom had just gotten off the Q train. He started walking back to his apartment. He approached the fruit and vegetable market at 17th Street and Avenue Z. Outside was a huge stack of pineapples. They were $1.50 each, or two for $2. What a deal, Dom thought. \r\nThen an idea struck him. Why not buy a pineapple for each neighbor in my corner of the building, he thought. He was new in the building. He didn’t know a single neighbor. Giving them a pineapple on Christmas Day might generate some communication. \r\nSo he bought six pineapples — one for each of his five neighbors, and one for himself. He carried home six plastic bags containing six fresh, delicious Hawaiian pineapples. When he got to his floor, he quietly placed a pineapple in front of each of his neighbors’ doors. \r\nHe opened his door. He was about to take his pineapple inside and slice it open when he had another thought. If his neighbors saw no pineapple in front of his door, they would assume that he had bought the pineapples. They might be grateful, or they might think that he thought he was a big shot because he had given them a pineapple. Or, they might feel resentful because now they \"owed\" him a thank you or maybe even a gift in kind. \r\nHe decided it was better that his pineapples be anonymous gifts. He left his pineapple just to the side of his door. He’d collect it later. Five hours later, he opened his door. He looked at his neighbors’ doors. All the pineapples were gone. He looked down.",
  "Shelly was working in her Manhattan office one night for the first time. No one else was in the office. At about 9 p.m., she heard a scratching noise. She got a little scared. She looked around. \r\n\"Hello,\" she said loudly. \"Is anyone there?\" Nobody answered. The scratching continued. She got up from her desk. She walked over to where the sound was coming from. She looked in a trashcan. She saw a small rat. It was trying to climb up the side of the plastic trashcan, but it was making no progress. Its claws were useless on the hard plastic. \r\n\"How did you even get into there?\" she asked the animal. Shelly was thankful that it was only one rat, and that it was a small one. She was glad it wasn’t one of the big rats she’d often seen on the subway tracks. She picked up another trashcan. She slid that trashcan into the trashcan with the rat in it. She walked downstairs carrying both trashcans. She went over to the doorman’s desk. \r\n\"I have something for you. I think it’s still alive,\" she said. She gave him the trashcans. He pulled out the top trashcan. \r\nHe said, \"Well, one down. How many to go? There are dozens of rats in this building. They’re most active at night.\" \r\nShe said, \"Well, this is my first rat, and I hope it’s my last. What happens if one of these things bites me?\" She went back upstairs.\r\nA week later, she was working in her office around lunchtime. The heat was on in the building. She smelled something. It wasn’t a good smell. At first, she thought it was a coworker’s body odor. Then she thought it was a coworker’s lunch. Then she thought it was a dead animal. She walked over to her manager’s desk. \r\n\"Something smells really bad. I think there’s something dead in our office,\" she said. \r\nHe said, \"I hope it’s not Mr. Evans. He’s getting up there. I can’t smell anything. Where is the smell coming from?\"\r\nShe led him over to the heating vent near the windows. He put his nose down near the vent. \r\n\"Phew!\" he said, as he jerked his head back. He called maintenance. A worker arrived a few minutes later. He opened the vent. He found two dead rats inside. \r\nShelly’s manager said, \"Boy, Shelly, what a good nose you have! How about coming up to the tenth floor with me and sniffing around? Maybe we have dead rats up there too.\"",
  "Jerry parked alongside the winding road next to his favorite golf course. He got out of his brand new Honda and took his clubs out of the trunk. He closed the trunk and stood there, admiring his new car. He carried his clubs to the clubhouse. He rented a pull cart and paid his greens fees. He walked out to the first tee. Nobody was on the fairway in front of him. He hit his drive and started walking up the fairway. \r\nThe first fairway was next to the road. He could see his car as he walked uphill. Suddenly he heard tires screeching. He heard somebody yell something. He looked up the road. A car was speeding downhill. It was going way too fast. Jerry watched in horror. Please don’t hit my new car, he prayed. The driver of the speeding car lost control. The car crashed into Jerry’s car. A fence separated the road from the golf course. Jerry ran over to the fence. He watched the driver get out of the car; he was laughing!\r\nThe driver started running down the road. Jerry climbed over the fence and ran after him. Another golfer called 911. Jerry couldn’t keep up with the driver. He lost sight of him. Jerry trudged back uphill to his car. It was totaled. He looked in the other car. On the passenger floor was a bottle of whisky. He saw a marijuana cigarette in the open ashtray. \r\nSeveral police cars drove up to the golf course. A policeman interviewed Jerry. Jerry saw a police helicopter searching for the driver. Jerry called his wife. She arrived in her car. He put his clubs and a few things from the Honda into her car. Tow trucks towed the two wrecked cars away. Jerry and his wife went home. \r\nThe police found the driver a day later. They charged him with various offenses. Later, the driver went to court. He told the judge he had had a flat tire. The judge made him pay a small fine. Jerry couldn’t believe it when he heard the news from a police officer. \r\nJerry said, \"That guy didn’t have a flat tire. He was speeding! He was drunk on whisky and high on pot. He totaled two cars. If I had been in my car, I’d be dead. He left the scene of the crash. He ran from the police. He had no insurance. He lied to the judge. And nothing happens to him?!\" \r\nThe officer said, \"Yeah, some people have all the luck. On the other hand, if you had been in your car and he had killed you, he probably would be in jail right now.",
  "It was early morning, January 17, 1994. Jim and his wife Alicia were asleep in their house in Northridge, California. Suddenly, the loudest thunder they’d ever heard seemed to explode right through the ceiling, the floor, and the walls. They were thrown onto the floor. The dresser, on the other side of the bed, crashed onto the bed, which was shaking and bouncing violently. Paintings and a mirror flew off the bedroom walls. Their bedroom windows broke and the walls cracked as the foundation of the house moved. \r\nTheir cat took off through a window and didn’t return for three days. Their two dogs covered their heads with their paws. Jim and Alicia scrambled to pick up the dogs and get out of the house, fearing that the roof and walls were going to collapse on them. They breathed easier once outside and saw their neighbors also running out of their houses. Jim and Alicia were only a half mile from the epicenter of the earthquake. Despite the wreckage to their home, which they had just bought, they considered themselves lucky just to be alive. They thought at first that they had just lived through the Big One, the one that scientists had said for years was going to destroy much of the Los Angeles area. But this wasn’t the Big One. It was big, but not nearly as big as the one that’s yet to come.\r\nThe Northridge quake was \"only\" 6.8 on the Richter scale (10 is maximum). There have been many earthquakes stronger than the Northridge one. The strongest quake ever recorded, 9.5, occurred in Chile in 1960. An earthquake in the Indian Ocean in December 2004 produced a tsunami that traveled at over 300 mph to hit Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and neighboring countries, killing 230,000 people. The underwater earthquake was measured at 9.0, and it produced as much energy as 1,000 atomic bombs. \r\nEach whole number on the Richter scale equals ten times the energy of the previous number. That is, a 3.0 quake is ten times as powerful as a 2.0 quake. Quakes are measured on instruments called seismographs.\r\nEarthquakes usually occur where tectonic plates meet. About 30 of these plates cover the Earth. They are several miles thick and huge in area — most of the Pacific Ocean sits on just one plate.\r\nEarthquakes occur when one plate strikes another or slides beneath another. Either action produces a huge amount of energy that travels upwards to the surface of the land or upwards to the surface of the ocean floor. A powerful ocean earthquake produces a tsunami, a fast-moving wave that can be anywhere from a few feet high to as much as 100 feet high, as in 2004.\r\nIt is well known that various kinds of animals act oddly just before an earthquake occurs. Researchers hope to discover how these animals can actually detect an earthquake, and which animals are best at accurately detecting earthquakes. They’ll use that knowledge to try to create an early warning system to save human lives. Humans will never be able to take the power out of an earthquake, but maybe someday, with the help of animals and technology, they can take the surprise out.",
  "Smaller than your fist, your muscular heart just goes on and on. It will beat more than 60 times a minute for 70 years or more. Yawn. So what? Most of us take our hearts for granted. Even many hearty people hardly notice their hardy hearts! \r\nYour heart beats 60 times a minute, or 3,600 times an hour. What physical thing can most of us do 3,600 times in one hour? Blink? Maybe, but after a while we’d probably get tired of or bored with the constant blinking. Tap our fingers on the desk? Nope. Jump up and down? Certainly not! \r\nBut your heart keeps beating, minute after minute, hour after hour. Every day, it pumps almost 2,000 gallons of blood through our blood vessels. The average bathtub can hold about 50 gallons of water (filled to the top without anyone sitting in the tub). So, your heart pumps about 40 bathtubs of blood every day. Unbelievable. Give your heart a pat on the back!\r\nAnd, unlike your head or your feet or your back, your heart does all this work without ever complaining! You never know that it’s even there. Your heart is such a reliable \"silent partner\" that people forget to care for it. For many people, the first indication that their heart isn’t functioning properly is death — a fatal heart attack! Over 650,000 Americans die annually of some kind of heart disease. Our hearts keep us alive, but they’re also our number one killer. Cancer kills 560,000, stroke kills 143,000, and accidents kill 118,000 Americans annually.\r\nLike accidental deaths, many heart disease-related deaths can be avoided if people simply follow the advice of health practitioners. Unfortunately, many people seem to listen to a little voice in their head that says, \"It won’t happen to me.\" So these people keep on smoking and drinking. They keep on eating salty snacks and fatty meat. And they keep on \"exercising\" by getting off the sofa, walking to the fridge, and grabbing another sugar-filled soda.",
  "Ever wonder how your pretty little eyes work? Light goes through the pupil, which is the black hole in the center of your eye. The light becomes an image on the retina, which converts the image into nerve impulses. Your brain reads these impulses and \"tells\" you what you are seeing. The image that the retina receives is upside down, but your brain reverses it to right-side up. That’s it, in a nutshell — or, in an eyeball, if you’d prefer.\r\nIn an experiment years ago, a brave researcher wore special lenses that turned everything upside down. He had no idea if his brain would be able to reverse everything after he stopped wearing the special lenses. After stumbling around for a while, he became used to the lenses because his brain corrected the images. To conclude his experiment, he stopped wearing the lenses. After a while, to his great relief, his brain returned his vision to normal.\r\nYour pupils get bigger as a light source gets dimmer, but they also get bigger if you see something, like a delicious meal, that interests you. \"Your eyes are bigger than your stomach\" is an expression parents use when a child fills his plate with more food than he can eat. \r\nPeople with vision problems are usually near-sighted or far-sighted. Near-sighted people see clearly only objects that are near; far-sighted people see clearly only objects that are far away. Both groups of people need corrective lenses (glasses or contacts).\r\nPeople whose near and far vision is good have \"20/20\" vision. People with poor eyesight might have 20/40 vision or worse. That is, a person with good vision can see an object from 40 feet away as clearly as a person with poor vision can see the object from 20 feet away. No matter how good their vision is when they are young, most people will need reading glasses when they get old. And we can thank an Italian for inventing glasses and an American for inventing bifocals.\r\nJust as there are only seven colors in the rainbow, there are only six basic colors for people’s eyes: amber, blue, brown, gray, green, and hazel. Brown is by far the most common color, with blue a distant second. Sometimes people mistakenly say that their eyes are black, but only their pupils are black, not their irises.",
  "It was a perfect day in Los Angeles. So perfect that even Shakespeare, had he lived another 370 years, might have said he himself had not the words to describe it. Everyone’s experienced such a perfect day at least once. The sun was shining, and soft white clouds were parked in the deep blue sky. The temperature was perfect for shorts and flops. Not cool, not warm — just perfectly in-between. A lazy breeze occasionally stirred the leaves on the trees. \r\nSuch a day isn’t typical. Most days in LA are quite hot. Most evenings are quite cool, even nippy. Also, inland weather is not always the same as beach weather. Burning up in Pasadena, you hop into your car and drive toward Santa Monica, thinking of diving into the refreshing cool ocean. Once you near the 405, however, you remove your sunglasses. What happened, you think. Where’d the sun go, you wonder, as you eye the gray sky, roll up the windows, and turn the heat on in your car. This doesn’t happen most of the time, but it happens enough that you learn to always pack a warm jacket and long pants for a trip to the beach.\r\nJune is a peculiar month. It’s preceded by about two months of hot weather and followed by about six months of hot weather. But June itself is usually cool, with a month-long gray sky that looks \"rainy,\" but it never rains. Although many locals find June weather to be refreshingly cool, the local TV weather people complain daily. Every June day, they ask, \"When is the ’June gloom’ going to end?\" They like to say \"June gloom.\" It rhymes, sort of, and it makes them feel clever.\r\nEventually, of course, the gray June sky reverts to a blue sky, with its yellow sun and high temperature. For the next six months, the local TV weather people complain about how hot it is. They ask, \"When will this weather cool down?\" They get excited if the temperature drops five degrees. They get excited if they learn about a faraway Pacific storm. They tell viewers that, even though it’s battering the coast of Japan, it might soon bring LA relief from the sun and the dry weather. Of course, it never does. They fill up their allotted time by pointing to every little city on the LA map and telling you its temperature, even though the temperature for one city is rarely one degree different from that of another city. It must be a boring job to be a weather person in LA.",
  "Mid-December through mid-March is often rainy and chilly. It’s jacket and umbrella time. Rain excites the local TV weather people. They get to remind viewers, in their best parental voice, to \"remember your umbrellas, watch out for traffic, and drive carefully!\" Pity the poor people who don’t watch TV. They probably forget their umbrellas, walk into traffic, and crash their cars every rainstorm. Another expression weather persons wear out during the rainy season is \"Storm warning!\" They love to say that, even though it rhymes less than \"June gloom.\" Sometimes, however, no storm follows the storm warning. You don’t have to watch TV news for long in winter to realize that the weather people are like the boy who cried \"Wolf!\"\r\nWhen a big storm hits LA, every TV station sends at least one reporter out into the streets. The reporter stands in the street near the biggest puddle he can find. The raindrops hit the puddle. The camera zooms in on the raindrops hitting the puddle. The camera zooms in on vehicles’ back-and-forth windshield wipers. The camera zooms in on people holding umbrellas or folded newspapers over their heads. Another reporter is sent to a nearby stream. The camera zooms in on the raindrops hitting the barely flowing stream and on the reporter’s feet as he stands ankle-deep in the stream. Two hours later, he is still standing only ankle-deep in the stream, but the camera zooms in anyway. The mild-mannered stream hasn’t become the angry river that the TV station producers had hoped to bring you. But, there’ll always be more storms. Hopefully, that reporter used an old pair of shoes and didn’t catch a cold.\r\nLocal TV weather persons do their best to make weather, which is boringly predictable 90 percent of the time in LA, interesting. Not only do they fail 90 percent of the time but also, aside from NBC’s Fritz, who wryly presents the weather and never displays the slightest bit of excitement, they make themselves look a little silly.",
  "His girlfriend wanted to have two babies — one boy and one girl. She wanted to have the boy first and the girl a year later. That way they could grow up together. He said that was okay with him. \r\nShe said, \"What do you mean, ’okay’? It shouldn’t be ’okay’ with you. You should say that you want two babies just as much as I do. If you don’t want two babies as much as I do, then forget it.\" \r\nHe said, \"Forget it? You mean that we won’t have two babies unless I really want to have two babies?\"\r\nShe said, \"Yes, that’s right.

  "Emily asked her husband if there was any news. He shook his head. She sat down on the sofa and took off her shoes. She put her feet on the coffee table. She picked up the remote and turned on the TV. It was 6 o’clock. The news was on three channels. She didn’t want to see the news. The news depressed her. It was usually about accidents and murders. There was too much bad news on the TV news.\r\nShe found a talk show to watch. It was Ellen. She liked Ellen. Ellen was a comedian. She told good jokes. She showed animals doing funny things. She gave expensive gifts to her fans occasionally. This show was a rerun, but that didn’t matter to Emily.\r\nAll she wanted to do was relax. Watching Ellen helped a little. Emily’s husband had just lost his job. Her only child had dropped out of high school. Even worse, he had left home. He told Emily he would call from time to time. But he hadn’t called even once. Tomorrow would mark two weeks since he’d left home.\r\nShe told her husband, who was sitting in the easy chair, \"I’m worried sick. We don’t know where he is. We don’t know if he’s even alive.\" Her husband said she shouldn’t worry. He had done the same thing when he was 17. But when he found out how hard it was on the road, he returned home and finished high school.\r\nShe said, \"I know. You’ve told me that story before. Your story has a happy ending. But this is Petey’s story. He could be lying dead in a ditch right now, killed by a drunk driver or stabbed by some homeless person that wanted his jacket. The police haven’t been any help. I can’t concentrate at work. I can’t relax at home. I can’t sleep at night.\" She started weeping.\r\nHer husband handed her a tissue. He sat next to her on the sofa and put his arm around her.

  "Marcia loved cats. She had two of her own. Their names were Spot and Dash. Spot had a white spot on his black face, and Dash liked to dash around Spot and the entire apartment. They were brother and sister, and she had gotten them for free when they were kittens. The cat in the dumpster had probably been run over, she thought. People drove too fast in her neighborhood, and cats were occasional victims. She never let Spot and Dash out of the apartment. They weren’t going to die in the street. Their only acquaintance with the great outdoors was when they sat on the window ledge in her living room.\r\nA couple of days after viewing the unfortunate cat, she was at a restaurant with a couple of friends. The restaurant served a variety of delicious hamburgers. She had tried, and liked, all of them. She ordered a hamburger, medium rare, as was her liking. When the waiter brought everyone’s orders, they all dug in. \r\nShe bit into her burger, and then spit it out into a napkin. She couldn’t eat her burger, and she couldn’t sit there and watch her friends eat their burgers. She made up an excuse, gave a friend enough money to cover her meal and tip, and left the restaurant.\r\nWhen she had bitten into her burger, she immediately pictured the dead cat. That was it for her. She refused to eat red meat anymore; she didn’t want to risk seeing that cat over and over. Fish and poultry were all right, though. She could still enjoy both without thinking of the dead cat. She promised herself that she wouldn’t lift the lids of any more foul-smelling dumpsters, just in case they contained a dead fish or chicken. Much worse, of course, would be if she actually saw a dead baby.",
  "Lisa got into her car. She hoped it would start. Twice in the past month, the car had not started the first time she turned the key. It had started the second time she turned the key, but that made her nervous. Sooner or later, she might have to turn the key three times, then four times, then four hundred times. \"Sooner or later,\" of course, might occur at the worst possible time in the worst possible place. Besides using the car for school and personal errands, she needed it for work. Without the money from her two jobs, she couldn’t pay her bills.\r\nShe had called her mechanic. He said to bring the car in when she had time. When was that, she wondered. She said she’d call him back. She had two jobs. Her day job was at Koss, a popular clothing store on Foothill Boulevard. As a new hire, she was at the bottom of the ladder. Her assignment, five days a week, was to rehang clothes on hangers. \r\nShe worked near the dressing rooms. Customers were allowed to take a maximum of five clothing items into the dressing rooms. They were given a tag with a number on it. The number matched the number of items they were taking into the dressing rooms. They returned the tag, with the items, to a worker when they exited the dressing rooms. The tag number and the number of items had to match, of course. \r\nLisa was not the worker who handed out and retrieved the tags. She was the worker who hung all the tried-on clothes back onto the hangers. Large signs in the dressing rooms said \"Please Hang the Clothes Back Up on the Hangers,\" but most customers ignored the signs. \r\nWhen she didn’t have any clothes to hang up, she kept busy folding clothes, picking clothes off the store floor where people had just dropped them under the racks and rehanging them on the racks, or putting clothes in their appropriate sections on the racks — small, medium, large. She also patrolled the store, picking up trash or out-of-place items that had been moved around by customers and looking for spilled liquids that needed immediate mopping up. \r\nEventually, she hoped to work her way up the ladder to be a cashier. Her boss, whom she had caught eyeing her a couple of times, had already offered her a cashier job, but there was a catch. She had to go out to dinner with him. She had demurred. He was, in a word, creepy. Further, he was fat, with a pock-marked face and a thick moustache, which he stroked far too often. She didn’t know which he loved more — himself or his moustache.",
  "It was a warm, sunny day. Marcia put a hat on to keep the sun out of her eyes. She needed to visit her bank. She had to withdraw some money from the ATM. She started walking down to the corner. There were four buildings at the intersection of Lima Street and Sierra Madre Boulevard. One was her bank. Just north of it was a fast food restaurant. A dry cleaner was catty-corner to the restaurant, and a small, one-story office building was catty-corner to the bank. \r\nLong before she arrived at the corner, she could smell the fried chicken. The restaurant was open seven days a week, and the odor of fried chicken was in the neighborhood daily. She didn’t mind the odor of deep-fried birds. She still ate poultry and fish, even though she had recently sworn off red meat. \r\nHer diet change had occurred suddenly about a month ago. She was walking to the post office on Baldwin Avenue. She smelled something that she guessed was a dead animal. The odor seemed to be coming from the dumpster ahead of her on the left. Ordinarily she would hurry by the dumpster. But because there had been several incidents in the TV news recently about people leaving dead babies in dumpsters, she decided to investigate this one. \r\nLifting one of the two plastic lids on the big dumpster, she held her breath as best she could and peeked inside with only one eye open. She didn’t see a dead baby. She was thankful for that. Instead, she saw a dead cat. Maggots, she guessed, were busy eating at its flesh and guts. The sight almost made her gag. She quickly dropped the lid, walked a few steps upwind, and took a deep breath of fresh air.",
  "After finishing her day at Koss, Lisa usually drove to her night job. She was a waitress, working four nights a week at a 24-hour restaurant called Lenny’s on Huntington Boulevard. She worked there from 6 p.m. till midnight. Most of her customers tipped her well. Older men gave her the biggest tips. Many of them asked her out, but they were all too old for her. \r\nYounger guys asked her out, too, but she was particular. She refused them all, waiting for the right one to ask her. She had seen the \"right one\" once, but he was with a girlfriend, she guessed. She hoped that, sooner or later, their relationship would end. She didn’t mind waiting. She was so busy, even if he did ask her, it would be hard to fit him into her busy schedule — but of course, she’d find a way to fit him in! \r\nWhen she wasn’t working, she was taking weekend college classes. Slowly but surely, she was going to get a degree. She wanted to get married eventually, but she also wanted to be an independent woman, before and during marriage. But that dream wasn’t going to work out if her car didn’t work right. That dream wasn’t going to work out if she got stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time and got robbed, mugged, or worse. She especially worried about being stuck at midnight at Lenny’s, with its poorly lighted and sometimes empty parking lot.\r\nHer mechanic wasn’t open on weekends. But since he was the only mechanic that she knew and trusted, she decided to ask her boss for a day off from Koss. Then she could still drive to Lenny’s that night after her car was fixed. She would miss only one day of work. That wasn’t too bad. \r\nHer boss would probably give her the day off — without pay, of course. She only had to worry about one thing. Her boss might give her the day off, but on one condition — that she have dinner with him. She knew what her response would be. She would say yes, but on one condition — that, before dinner, he shave his moustache off.",

  "Many Americans don’t understand the food labels, or Nutrition Facts, on the packages of their processed foods. The labels contain important information about what’s in the food, including the amount of salt, which is a very popular additive. Even though health practitioners and the federal government itself tell consumers to watch their salt intake, processors continue to add salt to packaged food. \r\nSalt occurs naturally in many foods. For example, raisins, as sweet as they are, contain the tiniest bit of salt. For many other foods that may already contain salt naturally, processors add more. Why? For some foods, particularly meat, salt works as a preservative. \r\nFor some foods, salt is added to increase thirst. Many bars offer free pretzels and peanuts to their patrons. The salty pretzels and peanuts increase the patrons’ thirst. They order another drink. And another. The pretzels and peanuts aren’t really free; they’re part of the cost of the drinks. \r\nThe most common reason to add salt is simply to add flavor to the food so that consumers buy it again. Consumers select many packaged foods with added salt while shopping in their supermarket. Parents often bring their kids along while shopping. Kids think shopping is fun, but parents can also make shopping a learning experience, as in the following dialogue between a mother and her son. \r\n\"Read the Nutrition Facts label to see how much salt is in this box of chicken noodle soup.\" \r\n\"Mom, there’s no salt at all in this soup.\" \r\n\"Yes, there is.

He turned on the kitchen water. Nothing came out. \r\nNone of the lights worked. The TV and his radio didn’t work. His computer didn’t work. His cell phone didn’t work. He looked out the window. Vehicles were moving on the street below, but nobody was gassing up at the corner gas station. Drivers were honking madly at one another in the intersection. The traffic lights weren’t working. What in the world is going on, he wondered. \r\nJust then, he saw the traffic lights start working. He heard his refrigerator motor kick in. Two lights came on in his apartment. He tried the water. It was working in both the kitchen and bathroom. He turned his TV on to a 24/7 news station. They were reporting the sudden end of a nationwide electricity shutdown. They were trying to contact mayors, governors, Capitol Hill, and government agencies as to what had caused the shutdown. They were trying to determine if the President was going to make a nationwide speech about the shutdown. Meanwhile, they speculated among one another about the who, what, when, where, why, and how.",
  "A little girl in a pink bicycle helmet slowly pedaled by on a pink bike with pink training wheels. Her parents walked behind her. An old couple slowly walked by. The man was using one of those aluminum, adjustable canes. They stopped and sat down on a bench next to Holly. They basked in the sun, not saying a word. \r\nA skinny lady in a red coat walked by. She had a strange gait, as if she had polio or some kind of hip injury. A threesome walked by speaking Russian. They were talking animatedly. Holly didn’t speak Russian, but she knew that they were talking negatively about one of their relatives.  \r\nA mother pushing an empty stroller with her young daughter walking alongside stopped at the metal railing that bordered the length of the walkway. Mom pulled a bag of sliced bread out of the back of the stroller. She tore up a slice into pieces and started throwing them to the ducks in the water. Her daughter watched and pointed at the ducks. Mom gave her daughter a slice of bread. Her daughter tore off a piece and ate it. Then she resumed pointing at the ducks while munching on their bread. \r\nThe old couple got up and resumed their walk, except now they headed back home. They still hadn’t said a word to each other.",
  "Holly walked down to Sheepshead Bay on a cool, winter day to enjoy the view from the wide walkway near Pier 10. She sat down on one of the many benches facing the bay. A group of young people walked by four abreast — man-man-woman-woman. Holly thought that was odd. \r\nA dad walked by pushing a stroller. The rock music he was listening to was loud enough for the baby to hear too. Holly saw the baby waving its arms. Was it dancing? A teen girl with dyed, bright red hair startled Holly as she zoomed by silently, and illegally, on her bike. Holly figured it was just a matter of time before she injured or killed a child or an elderly person.\r\nA dad walked by with his little girl, saying, \"Don’t do that. It looks stupid.\" Another little girl walked by, asking her mom repeatedly, \"What’s that?\" Two older women walked by arm in arm. Holly wondered why men never walked arm in arm. A woman walked by pushing the flimsiest stroller Holly had ever seen. It had four tiny wheels. Holly hoped that there was a dog, not an infant, inside the stroller.\r\nMissing Holly’s feet by inches, an old lady whizzed by on her big, red, four-wheeled motorcart. Holly didn’t even know the name of the vehicle. It wasn’t an electric wheelchair, and it wasn’t a car. But it looked like a small car. It looked like something that belonged on Emmons Avenue, not on the walkway. Holly hoped, but only a little, that the old lady would collide with the red-haired teen.",
  "After half an hour, the ’who’ took control of all of America’s computers. Every site displayed \"General Electricks.\" Underneath those words was the drawing of a pig on a plate with cash stuffed in its mouth. On the tip of its curly tail was a two-pronged plug. \r\nBeneath the pig appeared this message, as it was being typed: \"America is an electricity pig. Eventually, you’re going to poison the whole Earth with the pollution caused by your unrestrained use of coal, nuclear plants, natural gas, and oil to produce electricity. Our Earth will become unlivable. Do you think it’s your piggish right to destroy Earth and everyone on it? \r\n\"The power outage that America just experienced was only six hours, a mere wake-up call. I know what your electricity usage in kilowatt hours is daily nationwide. If your usage doesn’t go down 10 percent by seven days from now, your next outage will be 24 hours. You’ve got the brains, America. I’m giving you the motivation — a kick in your big, fat, electrically heated and cooled butt. Every year, I’m going to kick you again. Next year’s going to be a 72-hour kick. \r\n\"You have ten years to figure out how to derive 100 percent of your electricity from water, sun, and wind — with no pollution. If you fail, I won’t just shut down your power grid — I’ll destroy it. You’ll go back to living like the First Americans. And the rest of the world’s piggish nations will suffer the same fate at the same time. So, all of you, find a solution to end your pollution. Save our Earth, save our selves! I know you can do it. And don’t try to find me, or you’ll regret it.\" One minute later, the message disappeared.",
  "Somehow, he passed the interview and was accepted into the training program. In fact, as best he could determine, every person interviewed was accepted. He figured that the program had to have a high dropout rate to accept 100 percent of the interviewees. His three-month training class started a week later. \r\nClass was tough from day one. All trainees received two huge notebook binders, each containing about 600 pages. At the end of the first week, he promised himself that he would not be the first to drop out. Every day, the instructors presented more rules and regulations that students had to understand and memorize. All the students busily highlighted various sentences in various colors in their notebooks. \r\nSome rules and regs seemed to him to contradict one another. He constantly raised his hand to ask questions. Several times he asked classmates, \"Do you understand all this stuff?\" Most of them admitted they didn’t. He not only didn’t understand many of the rules and regs, but also couldn’t remember one from another. Despite his studying, they were all jumbled together in his mind. \r\nOn Friday of week seven, even though no one else had dropped out, he told the lead instructor, \"I’m finished. There’s too much information being presented too fast for me.\" \r\nShe said, \"I understand. It’s only going to get more difficult, so it’s probably best that you quit now. Frankly, I had figured you would be the first to go. I’m just surprised you hung in this long.\"",
  "He received an invitation to an interview for a New York City agency job. He’d taken a computerized test for that job about 16 months ago. He went to the agency’s website and looked at the job responsibilities. \r\nHe groaned. The job involved tons of paperwork. He thought about the pile of statements, receipts, and other papers in his apartment that he hadn’t organized in months. \r\nNevertheless, he decided to go to the interview. He had taken computerized exams for several other New York City agencies. Even though he had passed those exams, he had not received invitations to job interviews yet. He figured he would accept this particular opportunity and see how it played out. But the first chance he got to jump ship to another interview and another job, he would jump.\r\nHe went to the interview. Two workers asked him about a dozen questions and marked down how he answered each question. He was in a room where three other applicants were also being asked the same questions by other workers at other tables. Sometimes he was able to listen to other answers. He used a couple of those answers for his own answers. \r\nThe final question was, \"Why do you want this job?\" In truth, of course, he wanted it because he was unemployed and he would take just about any job that he could get. Instead, he said, \"My parents would be very proud of me to be an agency employee. Plus, this job would enable me to ’give back’ to my community, and it would make my life meaningful, purposeful, and fulfilling.\" He was proud of his response.",
  "Bob walked into the conference room. A representative from the credit union was offering workers a chance to win $500. That sounded good to Bob. When he walked into the room, a young man was sitting down at the big table. When he saw Bob walk in, he grinned and said, \"Hey, buddy!\" \r\nBob wasn’t anybody’s buddy. He said, \"Hey, buddy. How you doing, buddy? I came here to win that $500, buddy. Can you help me do that, buddy? Huh, buddy?\" Bob was tired of saying \"buddy.\" He hoped that the rep was tired of hearing it. \r\nThe rep said, \"Sure, buddy. Have a seat. Let me get some information from you.\" The rep asked, \"Your name?\" \r\nBob said, \"Buddy.\" \r\nThe rep asked, \"And your last name?\" \r\nBob said, \"Buddy.\" \r\nThe rep looked at Bob. \"Buddy Buddy?!\" \r\nBob said, \"Yes, buddy.\" \r\nThe rep typed in \"Buddy Buddy.\" He asked several more questions. Then he asked, \"Your mother’s maiden name?\" \r\nBob said, \"Buddy.\" \r\nThe rep said, \"Buddy again? Oh, I get it. You’re trying to tell me something. I shouldn’t call you ’buddy,’ right? That’s okay. My bad. What do you want me to call you?\" \r\nBob said, \"You’re sharp. How about the M word, or the S word?\" \r\nThe rep stared blankly, then asked, \"Second letter?\" \r\nBob said slowly, \"M is for Mister, and S is for — \" \r\nThe rep jumped in. \"Sir! Okay, I got it. You’re right, sir. Let me type a note to myself: Don’t call old guys ’Buddy.’\" \r\nBob said, \"Thank you, buddy.\"",
  "A police officer visited a former dog owner. Someone had shot and killed her 4-year-old pit bull. The officer knocked on her door. \r\nOpening the door, Beulah said, \"She’s exactly as I found her. I didn’t move a thing. Where’s your tape? Where’s your photographer?\" \r\nHe said, \"Excuse me?\" \r\nShe said, \"You know. The yellow crime scene tape. The forensic photographer. Don’t you watch TV?\" \r\nHe said, \"Ma’am, with all due respect to your dog, it doesn’t get the tape and photography treatment. Maybe the President’s dog would. Now can I see your dearly departed, please?\" She led him into the back yard.\r\nThe officer asked, \"Did your dog have any enemies?\" \r\nShe said, \"Not that I know of. Sugar was the sweetest thing this side of a candy store. She wouldn’t hurt a fly. All these know-nothings always bad-mouth pit bulls, but if they’d met my Sugar, they’d want her young’uns.\" \r\nThe officer said, \"Well, you know 311 has received complaints about her barking for over a year.\" \r\nShe said, \"Yeah, Sugar barked a bit, but that was because she was happy. Besides, nobody’d shoot a dog just because it barked. Well, maybe a crazy person. Crazy people’ll do anything. But, if you knock on enough doors, I’m sure you’ll find the killer — and the real reason they shot poor Sugar. I’m going to have a funeral for her out back here. Would you like to come? It might be worth your while. Killers like to show up at funerals, you know. They like to admire their work. It’s part of their sickness. You could arrest him before he kills again.\"",
  "The bag of Clementines was cheap. Three pounds for only $4.99. The usual price was two or three dollars more. What’s wrong with them, he wondered. Maybe they had seeds. He looked at the label on the bag. It said, \"May contain an occasional seed.\" He could live with that. He bought a bag. Over the next three days, he ate all the Clementines. He’d had to spit out about three seeds. \r\nHe went back and bought another bag. Back home, he offered to peel one for his wife. She declined. The first one he ate had at least 30 seeds. His tongue got tired from all the \"seed work.\" He called the 800 number on the label. A friendly woman in Florida answered. He told her about how many seeds he’d just spit out. She apologized. She asked for his address and the cost of the bag. She said she’d send him a check for $4.99. He thanked her. \r\nIt’s nice to deal with responsible people, he thought. He peeled another Clementine. It didn’t contain a single seed. That’s odd, he thought. He peeled another one. It didn’t contain a single seed either. He told his wife about the seedless Clementines. She said, \"You still have time.\" He asked, \"Time for what?\" She said, \"Time to call them back, and tell them to cancel the check.\" He said, \"No. That’ll just complicate things.",
  "During his radio talk show, the popular host said, \"Well, once again, nobody of color was nominated for an Oscar. Why? I’ll tell you why. Because the academy consists of nothing but old white guys, that’s why. Okay, Bob in Staten Island, go ahead.\" \r\nBob said, \"First of all, ’old white guys’ is disrespectful. How would you like being called an ’old brown guy’? Second, you’re saying that old white guys never vote for people of color. That’s not only false — it’s racist. \r\n\"Third, this country was founded by old white guys, in case you forgot. They wrote the First Amendment, which allows you to say what you just said. Then there are the old white guys who fought in World War II. Without them, you’d be speaking Japanese right now. I guess you forgot about that too. And what about the old white guys who created our national transportation and communication systems, health care system, and power grid?\r\n\"Finally, old white guys created light bulbs, motion pictures, air conditioning, elevators, planes, vaccines, TVs, computers, Cadillacs, Walmarts, and McDonalds. These are just some of the things that have helped make America the greatest country in the world, the country that everyone wants to come to. Then when they get here, some of them — like you — complain about the very people who made this country worth coming to. \r\n\"You bad-mouth them, yet you enjoy using everything they created. You’ve made a small fortune in America, yet you constantly talk about how great your home country is. So why are you here? Go back home. Make room for people who appreciate old white guys and everything they’ve done.\" \r\nThe host said, \"I’m not going anywhere, and I don’t owe old white guys anything. Everything they created, they built it on the backs of slaves and other people of color. Maybe you forgot that little fact.\"",
  "She took the mail out of her mailbox. Back inside her third floor apartment, she looked at the return addresses on the envelopes. Junk, junk, junk, she said to herself as she threw each unopened envelope into the trash. But she opened one envelope. It was from the NY Times. It was a first-time subscriber offer. The introductory price was much cheaper than newsstand or regular subscription prices — only $8 for eight weekend issues.\r\nShe called the 800 number. The rep said delivery would start that weekend. Saturday morning, she opened her door. There was no paper. She called the 800 number. The rep said that he would call the delivery service. \"You should get your paper by noon,\" he said. \r\nAt 1 p.m., she called the rep. \"I haven’t gotten my paper,\" she said. \r\nThe rep said, \"Really? Okay. You won’t be charged for it.\" \r\nThe next morning, she opened her door. There was no Sunday Times. She called the 800 number. The rep called the delivery service. The rep called her back. \"The delivery service said a lot of papers were damaged. Don’t worry, you won’t be charged.\" \r\nThe following Saturday, she opened her door. There was no paper. She called the 800 number. The rep said, \"Well, you know it snowed last night. A lot of people in Brooklyn didn’t get their paper. Don’t worry, you won’t get charged.\"",
  "The next morning, she opened her door at 7:00, 7:30, 8:00, and 8:30. There was no Sunday Times. At 8:30 she called the 800 number. The rep said he would order a redelivery. At 12:30, she called the 800 number. The rep who answered said, \"You know, there’s a note here that says that you have a ’locked lobby door.’ That means they can’t get inside your building. So the delivery is not to your apartment door; it’s to the area right outside your lobby.\"\r\nShe said, \"You mean they left the paper downstairs, and all this time I’ve been looking for it outside my apartment door? Why didn’t someone tell me that in the first place? I’ll go downstairs and check.\" \r\nThe paper wasn’t downstairs. She went back to her apartment and called the 800 number. The rep said he would give her credit for the day’s paper. \r\nShe said, \"You know what? The Times is now oh for four for a trial subscription. Why in the world would I pay full price for a regular subscription? I’d be calling you every week about missing or stolen papers. Just cancel my trial subscription, please.

  "Corey stood inside the drugstore on Ocean Avenue. It was 30 degrees outside. He kept looking north for an approaching B49 bus. The drugstore’s automatic doors opened. A man, about 30, stood outside. He did a slow \"dance\" at the doors. He looked exactly like a puppet on strings held by a novice puppeteer. His head went this way and that, as did each arm and leg. Slowly, he made his way through the doors. Once he got inside, he smiled. He was wearing only a sweatshirt and jeans, but he didn’t seem to notice the cold. \r\nHe said to Corey, who had been trying to be invisible, \"Excuse me. Do you know where I can find the Bay News?\" His speech was too loud, but clear. \r\nCorey said, \"The only place I know is the news box across the street.\"\r\nThe man said, \"Yes, I know, but it’s empty. Do you know why it’s empty?\" \r\nCorey said, \"Well, it’s Thursday. The paper comes out on Friday.\" \r\nThe man said, \"No. It’s empty because someone stole all the papers. That’s why it’s empty. Someone always steals all the papers.\" The man awkwardly and slowly walked back out into the bitter cold. Corey resumed looking for his bus. \r\nA lady who had witnessed everything said, \"That is why I don’t believe in God. No loving God would allow one of His children to be that broken.\"",
  "It was a sunny day all over the world — including the half that was opposite the sun. This had never happened before. Scientists were astounded. Then the sky everywhere turned black. The whole Earth was as dark as the inside of an inner tube. Flashlights, car lights, and streetlights did not brighten the blackness. A bright light appeared in the sky for all to see. \r\nA voice said, \"We’ve been watching you. You are a world of bullies. You need to learn to be nice to your neighbors. We’re going to start with world leaders, then work our way down the power ladder. We’re going to take the H-A-T-E out of E-A-R-T-H. We’re going to replace ’hatred’ and ’hurtful’ with ’nice.’ If you bully others, you’ll suffer horribly and publicly.\" Then the light went out, and the sun reappeared over half the Earth’s surface.\r\nSome world leaders scoffed. They didn’t believe the light had any power, other than to turn the entire sky black or blue. One world leader, Darth, the world’s most feared and most macho leader, immediately attacked the country that was his western neighbor. The attack lasted all of five minutes. Then Earth’s entire sky went black and the light reappeared. Dangling in the light for all to see was Darth. Suddenly, he started screaming. After about half a minute, he stopped. \r\nHe begged, \"Please, don’t hurt me again. I’m sorry! I’ll never do that again.\" Then he started screaming again. This time his screaming made dogs bark and cats howl. Finally, Darth stopped screaming. He begged and promised some more. The light released Darth back to Earth. \r\nFrom then on, there were no more wars. National leaders worked out their problems through conversation and compromise. Ordinary people started doing likewise. \r\nEvery year for the next 20 years, the light reappeared. It congratulated leaders and followers on their improved behavior, but it reminded them, \"We see all of you all of the time.\" Then a replay of Darth screaming in agony appeared for a full minute, and the light disappeared. \r\nIn the 21st year, the light failed to appear. One of the first to notice this was Darth.",
  "When Holly was little, her dad gave her a box of crayons. Holly’s first drawing was of her sleeping cat. \"Kitty\" was black and white. After using the red, yellow, green, and orange crayons, but not the black or white ones, Holly proudly showed her drawing to her mom. \r\nShe said, \"That’s nice, Holly. What is it?\" \r\nHolly said, \"It’s Kitty!\" \r\nHer mom said, \"It is? Show it to daddy, honey.\" \r\nHolly showed her drawing to her dad. He said, \"That’s nice, honey. What is it?\" \r\nShe repeated, \"It’s Kitty!\" \r\nHolly had drawn the insides of Kitty — brain, intestines, heart, and other parts. She had drawn the insides because she had a type of x-ray vision. Unknown to her parents until that day, Holly saw only the insides of living things. When she looked at her parents’ faces, for example, she saw bone, cartilage, tissue, muscle, and blood vessels. The only time she saw her parents’ real faces was when she saw their reflections or their pictures. Holly had always asked her parents, \"Why do you look different in pictures?\" Now they understood her question. \r\nHolly became an accomplished anatomical artist before graduating high school. She went to college and eventually earned a medical degree. While in med school, she drew pictures of anomalies in the heads or bodies — she could see through clothing — of some of her instructors and classmates. All of them needed treatment; some needed life-saving surgery. \r\nAfter graduating med school, she became \"Dr. Lifesaver.\" Using her drawing skills, special vision, and medical knowledge, she examined nearly 12,000 people a year for the next 30 years. She referred those who had tumors, diseases, and other abnormalities to specialists she knew. \r\nAfter 30 years, she learned that she herself had brain cancer. The operation that removed her cancer also mysteriously removed her \"x-ray\" vision. But Holly was happy to have gained normal vision. She retired, eager to spend the rest of her life with her husband, kids, and grandchildren. None of her kids or grandchildren had inherited her \"x-ray\" vision, but her oldest grandson had microscopic vision. If he wanted, he could see the microbes on doorknobs.",

  "It was a beautiful summer day in New York City. It was a day made for walking. John was standing at an intersection near the Brooklyn Bridge. He had driven over the bridge before. But he had never walked over the bridge. He started walking uphill on the pedestrian path. Many people were walking ahead of him. Many people were also walking toward him. They were coming from the Brooklyn side of the bridge. A bicycle path was next to the pedestrian path. Some pedestrians were walking on the bike path. A bicyclist approached. He rang his bicycle bell. Walkers slowly got out of his way. He kept ringing his bell. John continued walking uphill. A man was standing next to a large ice chest. He was selling bottled water. \"One dollar! One dollar! Ice cold water!\" he shouted. John wasn’t thirsty. He wondered how heavy that ice chest was.",
  "\"What’s the weather going to be like?\" he asked. She said there was a 20-percent chance of rain. \"Twenty percent?\" he said. \"Last week they said 20 percent, and it didn’t rain a drop. I’m not going to take my umbrella. Twenty percent means zero percent.\" She said, \"But the week before that, they said 20 percent, and it actually rained all day.\" He said, \"You’re right. They’re 50 percent with their 20 percent. But I hate carrying that umbrella around. Plus, the last time I took the umbrella, I left it at a restaurant.\" She said, \"Put a rubber band around your finger to help you remember the umbrella.\" He said, \"The last time I did that, I forgot to remove it and my finger got all puffy. I could’ve lost my finger.\" She said, \"Tie a string around your thumb. That’ll remind you to remove the rubber band.\"",
  "Next to the man were about 30 drawings. They were clipped to the fence beneath the handrail. There were drawings of bridges and buildings. There were drawings of people’s faces. All the drawings were black and white. John thought they were beautiful. He couldn’t believe the price. Each drawing was only $10. They were all about 8 inches by 11 inches. \"These are so beautiful,\" he told the man. The man was sitting on a folding chair. There was another folding chair next to him. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I from Russia. English no good.\" John said, \"But your art is very good.\" \"Sit, sit,\" the man said. \"You, you.\" The man pointed at John with his pen.

They put us in their tub and give us baths.\" The cat said, \"They don’t take us for walks because there’s a litter box in the house. If we want to catch something, we catch birds or mice. They don’t give us baths because we clean ourselves. And one more thing — they respect our independence. They don’t put a chain on our neck and a leash on the chain.\" The dog said, \"I’d rather have a leash than have their kids pulling my tail all the time.\"",

If I can’t, I will call you.\" The conversation lasted a few more minutes. Bill was impressed. Byron was very polite. He seemed friendly. He seemed trustworthy. A little later, Bill took his computer to Byron’s office. Byron’s wife was his secretary. She was very friendly. All three talked about Bill’s computer, the weather, the Yankees, and the \"good old days.\" They’re a really nice couple, Bill thought as he left Byron’s office. I think I have two new friends. The next morning, Bill called Byron. \"How’s it going?\" Bill asked.",
  "The man looked at John. \"Sit, sit,\" he repeated. John smiled. He waved goodbye to the man. Maybe I should buy a few drawings on my way back, he thought. Maybe that old man will be famous some day. Maybe my drawings will be worth millions. He could see the Statue of Liberty. It looked so small. There were many ships and boats on the river. Some boats were full of tourists. They were going to the Statue of Liberty. They were circling Manhattan Island. John reached the first of the two towers. He looked up. It said \"1875\" on the tower. Vendors were selling T-shirts, CDs, food, and drinks. People were taking pictures and reading plaques. John admired the tower. He admired the view. Half an hour later, he started walking toward the second tower.",
  "The pedestrian path and the bike path gradually rose above the cars. John looked down at the cars. He was walking east, toward Brooklyn. The eastbound cars below were moving quickly. But the westbound cars, coming into NYC, were creeping along. There was a traffic jam. John was walking faster than those cars were moving. He was happy to be walking east instead of driving west. A nice breeze made his walk pleasant. He walked past people taking pictures. They were taking pictures of the bridge. They were taking pictures of the East River. They were taking pictures of buildings. They were taking pictures of one another. A woman asked John to take a picture of her and her boyfriend. Or was he her husband? He took their picture. They thanked him. He continued walking uphill. An old man was sitting next to the handrail. He was drawing the bridge.",

We were in training 12 days straight. We worked almost 16 hours a day. We learned how to make ten new menu items. You’ll see them on the menu next month. Everything was free! I had my own private room in the hotel. The food was fantastic. The hotel had six different restaurants. I ate all I could eat three times a day.

What city?\" He said, \"I don’t know. I didn’t even see a city. All I saw were the hotel and the training center.\"",
  "He bought a six-pack of an energy drink. He’d never tried it before. The ads promised four hours of energy. He drank the little bottle. He waited for the energy to kick in. He needed to cram for a test the next morning. Nothing happened. I can’t wait all night, he thought. He drank another bottle. This’ll give me EIGHT hours of energy, he thought. That meant He’d be up until 4 a.m. Nothing happened. He drank another bottle. Now I’ll be up till 8 a.m., he thought. But that was no good, because the test started at 8 a.m. He drank another bottle. He started studying for the test. He couldn’t concentrate. His eyes felt like they were crossing. His head felt like it contained a live electric wire. He couldn’t study, and he couldn’t sleep. Somehow, he managed to pass the test. No more cramming, he promised himself.",
  "The couple stood in line at Bellevue Hospital. They were on the fourth floor. They were first in line. Three workers sat behind the main desk. One of them, a slim woman, said, \"Step down.\" Doug and Sandra looked at each other. Step down? There was no step. The floor was completely flat. The only steps were in the stairwell beside the elevator. The woman repeated herself. She looked right at them. They pointed to themselves. She nodded. They stepped forward. \"Did you say ’step down’?\" Doug asked. She nodded. Sandra gave her a piece of paper. \"There are no steps,\" Doug said. \"You should say ’step forward.’ No one understands ’step down.’\" The woman wrote a phone number on the piece of paper. She said, \"Call this number on Monday.\" She gave the paper back to Sandra. She looked at the people next in line. \"Step down,\" she said.",
  "He was standing on the busy sidewalk. He was looking straight up. They were building a high-rise at 32nd Street and 6th Avenue. It had hundreds of huge glass windows. A crane was lifting a dumpster. The dumpster was about 20 feet in the air. He watched it rise. What if the cable broke? The dumpster would drop like a rock. How many people on the sidewalk would it injure? Something rolled over his foot. He looked down. A woman said, \"Oh, I’m sorry. Are you okay?\" She was pulling her grocery cart. \"No problem,\" he said. He went back to watching the dumpster. \"What’s so interesting?\" she asked. She looked up, too. Then he smelled something foul. It was cigarette smoke. She had lit a cigarette. He couldn’t believe it. He was there first. It was his space. He walked away. Maybe it will drop on her, he thought.",
  "It was time for her yearly checkup and teeth-cleaning. The dentist examined her gums and teeth. He said that she had a lot of plaque and tartar. He recommended a \"deep cleaning.\" She asked what that was. He said that it would take two visits. He would clean her top teeth first. He would clean her bottom teeth second. Each visit would take two hours. \"How much will it cost?\" she asked. \"It will cost four times as much as a regular cleaning,\" he said. \"I can’t,\" she said. \"I don’t have the time or the money.\" He tried to convince her to get the deep cleaning. She refused. He turned cold. He silently gave her the regular cleaning. But he did it fast, and it hurt. \"He taught me a good lesson,\" she told her husband. \"What lesson?\" he asked. \"He taught me to find another dentist,\" she said.",
  "She was in a hurry. She wanted something fast for breakfast. He told her to have milk and cereal. She said that milk upset her stomach. \"Don’t you know that by now?\" she asked. He said there was soybean milk in the refrigerator. \"What kind of cereal do we have?\" she asked. He told her they had Grape Nuts and Shredded Wheat. \"Yuck!\" she said. \"Don’t we have anything tasty?\" He said that a spoonful of sugar would make the cereal taste better. \"But sugar might raise my cholesterol,\" she said. He said that sugar doesn’t raise cholesterol — meat does. \"If you really want to lower your cholesterol, you should stop eating meat,\" he said. She said she loved meat. She would never stop eating meat. Meat was much more important to her than her cholesterol level. \"If someone invented steak cereal, I’d eat three bowls a day!\" she said.",
  "Doug and Sandra walked away from the desk. \"Boy, she wasn’t very polite,\" Doug said. \"She didn’t say ’Good morning.’ She didn’t say ’Have a nice day.’ What did she write on the paper?\" The woman had written a phone number on the paper. \"I thought we were going to get an appointment,\" Doug said. Sandra was upset. \"Well, we didn’t get an appointment, did we? You had to correct her English, didn’t you? You upset her. So, she didn’t give me an appointment with a doctor. Now I have to wait until Monday before I can make an appointment.\" Doug said, \"Of course I corrected her. She was speaking incorrect English. Who ever heard of ’step down’ when there are no steps? I tried to make her a better speaker. I tried to get her to speak correct English.\"",
  "Do you sleep alone? Or do you just think you sleep alone? Maybe your bed is not just your bed. Bedbugs are taking over the USA. The little pests are about the size of an apple seed. Many big cities have them. The Big Apple has them. They are in hotels. They are in theaters. They are in department stores. They are in apartment buildings. Their favorite place in an apartment is the bedroom. Their favorite place in a bedroom is the mattress. At night they crawl out of the mattress.

  "Linda’s apartment intercom buzzed. She picked up the intercom phone. \"Hello,\" she said. \"The UPX man is coming up,\" said Julia. Julia worked at the front desk. Finally! Linda had been waiting two weeks to return a package. She took the package to the front door. She waited for the doorbell to ring. She thought she heard someone. She opened the door. No one was there. She shut the door. She stood just inside the door. A few minutes went by. She stared at the package. Where was this guy? Did he get lost? Did the elevator get stuck? Did he go to the wrong floor? Maybe she should call Julia back. KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! Linda almost jumped out of her skin. Was he trying to break the door down? She couldn’t believe the door was still on its hinges. \"UPX!\" the man yelled at the top of his lungs.",
  "He said that he felt bad because she had lost her client last week. \"You should feel bad. It was your fault,\" she said. He said it wasn’t totally his fault. \"We missed the first train by a few seconds. Yes, that was my fault. So we got to Costco 20 minutes late. We got home 20 minutes late. But you still had plenty of time to make your appointment. But you ate a big lunch. Then you took a long shower,\" he said. \"I always eat a big lunch,\" she said. \"I always take a long shower.\" \"You should have kept your 1 o’clock appointment,\" he said. \"Instead, you told your client to meet you at 2 o’clock.

  "\"Mommy, look at my paper,\" said Sandra. \"My teacher wrote me a note.\" Her mom looked at the paper. It was a math test. At the top it said, \"50% — You’re such a loser.\" Her mom screamed. She said, \"Did Mr. Brown write this note? How dare he? I’m calling your school right now.\" She went into the living room. Sandra heard her mom yelling on the phone. A little later, she came back into the kitchen. \"Don’t pay attention to that note, honey. Just because you fail a test doesn’t make you a loser. You’re a winner, honey. You’re the best little girl in all the world. Don’t worry about your score. Your daddy and I got 50% on many tests in school. We’re not losers, and neither are you. But you know who is a loser?

  "Barry called Gene from work. The two of them talked only occasionally. They used to be best friends. Barry asked how everything was. He asked about Gene’s health. While Gene was answering, he heard someone talking to Barry. What’s going on, Gene wondered. A coworker was talking with Barry. The conversation lasted about 20 seconds. Finally, Barry said, \"I’m sorry. Susan asked me a question.\" Gene asked, \"Couldn’t she see you were on the phone?\" Barry said, \"Yes, but she needed a fast answer.\" Gene said, \"That’s rude.\" Barry said, \"Sometimes she forgets her manners.\" Gene said, \"She was rude, but you were rude, too.

  "Sam had lost his new teaching job. His supervisor had told him, \"I’m sorry. When we don’t get enough new students, I have to lay off the newest teachers.\" But Sam was the only new teacher who’d been laid off. All the other new teachers were still working. Why him, he wondered. \"Was it something I said or did? Something I didn’t say or do?\" he asked his wife. His wife asked, \"Were you the last teacher hired?\" He said he wasn’t. \"Are you the oldest new teacher?\" she asked. \"Oh, yeah,\" he said. \"I’m much older than the others.\" She said, \"That’s why.\" He looked at her. \"Don’t you see?\" she said. \"You’re too old.\" He told her that people can be too old for many jobs, but not for teaching jobs. \"Some of the best teachers are old teachers,\" he said.

He told the male employee, \"You better not call the police. Do you live around here? I better not see you on the street.\" \"Are you threatening me?\" the employee asked. Five other customers were near Drew. Three other employees were also nearby. No one said a word. Everyone watched and listened. \"I didn’t steal nothing. You call the cops, and I’ll fight every one of them. You think I won’t?\" the young man said. \"Sign here, please,\" the employee said. The man signed a form. He broke the pen in two.

He said that was ridiculous — nobody shaves their ears. \"Nobody? I just told you my brother does,\" she said. \"Don’t knock it till you try it.\" He decided to try it. He went into the bathroom. He put shaving cream on both ears. He grabbed his razor. His wife walked in.

All I saw was a hand.\" She said, \"He’s under the horse. You have to look really hard. I think the wings confuse people, too.\" He agreed. \"You’re right. I didn’t even know they were wings.

  "It was 8 a.m. Larry was running late. Had he done everything? He had brushed his teeth. He had brushed his tongue. He had gargled with mouthwash. He rushed out of his apartment. He took the M16 bus to 23rd Street. The bus was crowded. A young woman pressed against a window to avoid a fat man who was standing too close to her. Larry got off the bus and walked to the NYU dental center. He went to Patient Admissions. He filled out the forms and paid $95. He went upstairs with his student dentist. She was a pretty girl from India. He asked what her first language was. She said Hindi was the national language of India. Each of India’s 26 states had its own language, also. \"So you speak three languages?\" he asked. She said she spoke Hindi, Punjabi, and English. He sat in the dental chair.",
  "Toyota was in the national news. It was recalling a million cars. It wanted to check all their brakes. Jack was driving his new Toyota. He dialed 911. \"Help! My brakes don’t work!\" he said.

He carefully braked. Both cars slowly stopped. Jack got out of his car. He hugged the patrolman. A TV news helicopter was filming everything. Jack was on the national TV news. \"It was terrible,\" he said. \"I almost died. Of course, I’m going to sue Toyota.\" Toyota examined Jack’s car. It said nothing was wrong with the brakes.

Max liked that idea. \"That saves me about $40,\" he said. \"Plus the tip,\" Dave added. Dave escorted Max to Penn Station. Max bought a ticket to Jamaica Station. The train was on Track 13.

Max jumped onboard. \"I was too fast for them this time,\" he said, laughing. Dave reminded him to get off at Jamaica Station. They said goodbye. The train left the station. Max emailed Dave a few days later. \"I made a big mistake,\" he wrote. \"I didn’t realize how fast the train was. Somehow I missed Jamaica Station. It was the first stop. I got off at the next stop.

Roy said, \"About six times a day, out of the blue, I say to myself, ’I love her so much!’\" Frank said that did sound a bit much. \"Do you ever do that?\" Roy asked. Frank said he used to, just after his wedding. \"But that wasn’t six times a day. And I can’t remember the last time those words just popped into my head,\" he said. \"Do you ever say you love her?\" Roy said that he told his wife he loved her at least twice a day. \"How long have you two been married?\" Frank asked.

  "He took the No. 1 train to Columbia University. He explored the campus. There were many sculptures. The sculpture at Greene Hall was massive. The sculpture was about 10 yards high and wide. It sat on top of the entranceway roof. The roof was about 12 feet high. The top of the sculpture was higher than the fourth floor of the building. But what was it a sculpture of? He wasn’t sure. He could see four legs and a horse’s head. The horse’s mouth was wide open. He could see a hand next to the horse’s head. But where were an arm and a body? He could see other stuff that he did not recognize. So, it was a horse and a human — maybe. If the artist wanted people to wonder, he had done a good job. A plaque might explain this thing. He looked, but he couldn’t find one.",

  "The Staten Island train ride was about an hour. There were about 20 stops. The view for most of the ride was trees and houses. The train finally arrived at Tottenville, the last stop.

There are more animals than there are stars,\" Abraham said. But every year they had to hunt a longer time than the year before. Every year they saw fewer animals. Every year Jacob said, \"Maybe we are killing too many animals.\" Every year Abraham said, \"There are more animals than there are stars. They have learned how to hide from us.

He returned to the cashier. She rang up the grapes. The grand total was $35. That was much more than he had expected. He paid her. She gave him his receipt. He took the N train and his groceries home. Once home, he put his groceries away. Then he looked at his receipt. Each item had a name, price, and weight. One item had no name and no weight. That one item cost $13.10. What was it? He’d bought nothing that cost $13.10. He thought back. A man had been in line right behind him. He had placed an item on the counter.",
  "It was Ray’s first visit to the store. It was on a busy street in Chinatown. The vegetables looked fresh. The store also sold fruit, meat, and fresh fish. It sold different kinds of noodles. It was a small store, but it looked clean. An employee smiled at him and said hello. If the prices were right, he might start shopping here regularly. He grabbed a handful of plastic bags. He put different vegetables into each bag. He grabbed some red grapes for his wife. He put the bags on the counter next to the cashier. He told her he would be back. He grabbed a package of noodles. He put sweet potatoes and cucumbers into separate bags. He went back to the counter. There were now about ten bags on the counter. The cashier asked if he was ready. He said he was. She started ringing up the items.",
  "\"You lied,\" she said. \"I just read that seniors must be 65 or over. You are only 63. Yet when we went to the AMC theater, you got the senior discount. You told the woman you were a senior. You lied to get a $4 discount.\" He said that a \"senior\" could be different ages. Usually, a senior must be 65 or older. But the AMC theater allows seniors to be only 62. \"Are you lying now?\" she asked. He said to give him just one minute. He called the AMC theater on 34th Street. He used the speakerphone. A woman answered. He asked, \"Do you give discounts for seniors?\" She said yes. \"How old must a senior be?\" he asked. She said 62. He smiled. \"You owe me an apology and a kiss,\" he told his wife. \"I’m so sorry,\" she said. Then she gave him a big kiss.",
  "It was her 47th birthday. \"I’m 50 years old,\" she said. Her husband said no, she wasn’t. She was only 47. She was still a young pup. \"I’m not a young pup, and I’m not a spring chicken,\" she said. \"Okay,\" he said, \"but you’re also not 50.\" She said 47 might as well be 50 — what was the difference? \"People look at me and they think I’m 50. Nobody says, ’Oh, you don’t look a day over 47.’\" He told her that time goes by fast enough. She didn’t need to make it go faster. She still had three years of her 40s to enjoy. He gave her a birthday card. She opened it. The card read, \"Happy 50th Birthday!\" \"What’s this?\" she asked.",
  "The weather was ugly. It was snowing. It was only nine degrees above zero. Cars, streets, and sidewalks were covered with snow. Bob was on the phone. \"Have you ever seen a colder day?\" Bob asked. \"Not recently,\" replied Jack. \"But about three years ago, I did. It was so cold that my dog froze outside. I had let it out back to do its business. Then I went back inside my house. My mom called. Her heater was not working. She was freezing. I went over to her house. I fixed her heater. I went home. Then I remembered my dog. I went to the back door. I opened it. My little dog was on the porch. It wasn’t moving. I brought it inside. It was ice cold. I wrapped it in a blanket. I breathed into its mouth and pumped its little chest. But it was too late.\"",
  "The apartment doorbell rang. Two men were there to clean out the kitchen and bathroom vents. Lou invited them in. One man took a ladder into the bathroom. The other man took a ladder into the kitchen. They removed the vent grills from high on each wall. They stuck a vacuum hose into the vents and sucked out the dirt. One man washed both vent grills in the kitchen sink. The men replaced the grills. Lou was talking to the man in the kitchen. He forgot about the man in the bathroom. The man in the kitchen finished. He took his ladder outside. The other man appeared. He also carried his ladder out. They both said goodbye. Lou went back to the bathroom. Why was the door closed, he wondered. He opened the door. He looked at the toilet. The seat was up.",
  "\"Stop pulling out your eyebrow hair,\" his wife said. \"In China, that’s bad luck. It’s bad luck for the man. It’s bad luck for his wife and family.\" He said he wasn’t Chinese. He said he didn’t live in China. He hated bushy eyebrows. \"Hair must be controlled,\" he said. \"Hair is like weeds. It needs to be pulled out or cut back occasionally. Do you want to see hair growing out of my nose? Do you want to see hair growing out of my ears?\" She agreed that nose hair and ear hair weren’t pretty. But she loved bushy eyebrows. They meant that a man would have a long life. They made a man attractive. She asked him not to pull his eyebrow hair out anymore. He groaned. \"Let me think about it,\" he said. She said, \"Don’t think about it. Just do it — for us!\" He groaned again.",
  "Her stomach was killing her. Whenever she was stressed out, the stress went straight to her stomach. \"How bad is it?\" he asked. \"It’s almost as bad as childbirth,\" she said. \"It’s 9 on a scale of 10.\" She squeezed her eyes shut for a moment. Her stomach was bloated. He gave her a stomach massage. He gave her a lower back massage. Her stomach still hurt. She stood up. She walked around. She groaned over and over. She said, \"I’m hurting,\" over and over. He stood by. There was nothing he could do. They had gone to doctors before. They always said the same thing: gas. They recommended gas relief tablets. Sometimes the tablets worked, and sometimes they didn’t. She took two tablets. Almost an hour later, she blasted out a huge fart. He laughed. She smiled. Most of the pain was gone. \"I feel much better,\" she said.",
  "He told his wife that he was going to Chinatown. He was going to buy a bag of rice. She said to wait until next week. The streets and sidewalks were still icy. He said he would be careful. She frowned. He said he would be back in an hour. She frowned again. Chinatown’s streets and sidewalks were indeed icy. But he didn’t slip or fall. He finished his shopping. He took the R train home. His wife was still upset. She said he was lucky he hadn’t fallen. She had been worried the whole time he was gone. \"Why don’t you listen to me?\" she asked. \"Why do you always make me worry?\" He said, \"I got you something nice from Chinatown.\" She said she didn’t want anything nice from Chinatown. He gave her a package of fresh-cooked squab. Her frown disappeared. \"I’ll forgive you this time,\" she said.",
  "A storm dumped 20 inches of snow on New York City. Kids loved the snow. Commuters hated it, especially commuters who drove cars. Snowplows pushed the snow off main city streets. But they pushed the snow up against parked cars. Elton’s car was on a street in Brooklyn. A snowplow had pushed a huge pile of snow against the side of his car. He grabbed his snow shovel. He started digging his car out. He put the snow back into the street. A cop drove by. He told Elton that it was illegal to put snow into the street. He said it was a $100 fine. Elton said, \"I need to get to work. Where else can I put this snow? Where else can my neighbors put it? Are they going to fine all of us?\" The cop drove off. Elton continued to put the snow back into the street.",
  "Ada was lonely. She wanted a baby. She went to a hospital. She stole a baby. She called her baby Norma. When she got older, Norma asked, \"Where is my daddy?\" Ada said that \"daddy\" had died. Norma asked, \"What did daddy look like?\" Ada showed Norma a picture of \"daddy.\" Norma asked, \"Why don’t I look like you or daddy?\" Ada said that she didn’t know. Norma thought something was fishy. She thought she was a missing child. She did a lot of research. She made a lot of phone calls. She found out who her real parents were. She called them up. They couldn’t believe it. Their little girl had found them after 20 years! They were so happy. Ada apologized to them. She was sorry she had stolen their baby. Norma’s parents didn’t accept Ada’s apology. They said Ada should go to jail for a long time.",
  "KF was selling a Family Bucket for only $12. The ads were on TV. Josh went to a KF on Broadway. A big sign in the window said Family Bucket $12 — eight pieces of chicken, cole slaw, and mashed potatoes. Josh went inside. He ordered the Family Bucket. The worker said, \"We’re not KF.\" She said to go to the rear. Josh didn’t understand. \"We sell Nathan’s hot dogs,\" she said. \"KF is back there.\" He walked to the back of the big room. There was only one KF register open. But, there was only one person in front of him. This shouldn’t take long, Josh thought. Five minutes later, that person’s order got filled. Josh told the worker that he wanted the Family Bucket. She said that would be $26. He said no, it was only $12. \"It’s all over TV,\" he said.",
  "The worker had no idea what Josh was talking about. He walked back outside to check the sign in the window. Yes, it said Family Pack $12. He walked back inside. He waited for the person in front of him to get her order filled. Then he told the worker about the sign again. She called the manager over. He said yes, there was a Family Pack for $12. Relieved, Josh ordered it. The manager asked whether he wanted Extra Crispy, Original, or Grilled chicken. Josh didn’t know which one his wife preferred. He ordered a mix of all three. Then he changed his mind. His wife was a health nut. He said Grilled. The worker filled a big bag with all the food. Josh went home. His wife asked him what took so long. She didn’t wait for his answer. \"I hope you got the Original chicken,\" she said.",
  "His knee was killing him. Whenever he walked, it felt like a knife was going into his knee. He called Bellevue Hospital. A woman answered. He said he wanted to get an appointment with a knee doctor. \"Do you have a referral?\" she asked. He said no. \"Then you’ll have to see a regular doctor first,\" she said. \"I can’t give you an appointment for a regular doctor now. You’ll have to call back for an appointment in October.\" His jaw dropped. \"This is March! Did you say October?\" She said yes. \"You don’t have a clinic card,\" she said, \"so the earliest appointment is October.\" He said he did have a clinic card. \"Give me the card number,\" she said.

James said, \"I asked downstairs if anyone has a key to our classroom. But no one does.\" Students talked to each other or read while they waited. The teacher arrived 45 minutes late. He unlocked the classroom door. Everyone went in. \"Did you know there’s a big half-marathon today?\" the teacher asked. \"I didn’t. Why wasn’t it on the news last night or this morning? I apologize.

  "He bought some ties at Daffy’s. Marked \"Final Sale,\" they were only $15 each. Originally, they were $100 each. Who would pay $100 for a tie, he wondered. He bought five of them. He went home. He showed them to his wife. She didn’t like any of them. \"But they’re worth $100 each,\" he said. She said, \"I don’t care if they’re worth $1,000 each. They’re ugly! I won’t go anywhere with you in those ties.\" He went back to Daffy’s. He went to the Returns counter. He showed the ties and the receipt to the worker. He said he wanted to exchange the ties.

No one was talking to him. All of these people really seem to like each other, he thought. They all seem to have made new friends in class. How did they make friends so easily? He hadn’t made any new friends. He hadn’t even made a new acquaintance. He picked up his briefcase. He walked out of the classroom. He walked over to the elevators. He pushed the elevator button.

He read the manual. The manual said nothing about how to set up the wide-angle! He went back to the camera shop. He asked a worker how to set up the camera for wide-angle. The worker showed him. He said, \"Go to Function. Set the camera on S. S is wide-angle. It also uses fewer pixels, so you can put your pictures online quickly.\" Roger went to four apartments. He took 43 pictures. He uploaded them to his office computer. Not a single picture was wide-angle. Roger asked a coworker for help. \"Why is it on S? S stands for small!\" she said. \"You have to set the camera on W — W for Wide.",

  "In his final years, he rarely talked to anyone. As a boy, he had talked to everyone. He was curious about everything. He asked everyone questions about everything. As he got older, he began to notice something. People didn’t answer his questions as often as they used to. Sometimes people didn’t answer his questions at all. Many times they answered his question with their own questions: Who knows? Who cares? Are you writing a book? So he gradually stopped asking questions of people. Then he gradually stopped talking to people. After he died, his brother collected his belongings, including his computer. One of his computer files was his journal. It was over 4,500 pages long. The first sentences were: Why bother talking? People are just too busy to listen. I write because my computer accepts my every word. It never ignores me. It never patronizes me. It never interrupts me.",

Arnie said, \"Sure, I’ll be happy to teach you how to play golf, Superman.\" Arnie filled a bucket with golf balls. He told Superman to follow him. He gave Superman a 7 iron. He showed Superman how to grip the club. \"The correct grip feels uncomfortable at first,\" he told Superman. Superman said, \"No, it feels fine. Let me hit a few balls.\" Arnie said sure. He put a golf ball on the grass. Superman hit the golf ball with the 7 iron. WHACK! Arnie’s ears hurt. The golf ball took off like a rocket. Then it burst into flames. Then it disappeared. All that remained was black smoke. Arnie told Superman to hit another ball. Superman said sure. The same thing happened again! Now there were two little clouds of black smoke.",
  "\"Are these balls defective?\" Superman asked. Arnie shook his head. \"Look around. Look at all these golfers hitting balls,\" Arnie said. \"Do you see any balls bursting into flames?! No, it isn’t defective balls, Superman. It’s you! You’re too powerful.\" Superman asked, \"Well, what can I do? I like hitting golf balls. It’s fun! Do they make steel golf balls? Maybe they won’t burst into flames.\" Arnie said, \"No. Even if they did make steel golf balls, they’d probably melt once you hit them. I’m sorry. Golf isn’t a game for a superman. It’s a game for ordinary men.\" Superman frowned. He thanked Arnie for his help. Then he flew away. The next day, an ordinary-looking man appeared at the driving range. He was wearing glasses and a nice suit. \"Hi,\" the man said to Arnie. \"Can you teach me how to play golf? My name is Kent — Clark Kent.\"",

But Shy had gotten fired. \"Exactly what did you say to your supervisor?\" the lawyer asked. \"I told her to kiss my ass,\" Shy said. \"What’s so bad about that?\" Shy had worked for the company for many years. \"She thinks I have an attitude problem,\" Shy said. \"She’s been there for five years.

The names of the bridges were the Williamsburg Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge. He looked at the two bridges again. Where was the Manhattan Bridge? He knew it was just north of the Brooklyn Bridge.

  "LinkedIn was in the news. The company’s Initial Public Offering was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Lonny called his broker at 8:00. \"I want to buy LinkedIn,\" he said. \"The pre-IPO price is $45. But the opening price might be up to 30 percent higher, right?\" His broker said, \"Yes, 30 percent higher — or lower — is the rule of thumb.\" Lonny said, \"I want to buy 3,000 shares with a limit price of $60. I’m hoping it opens at $45. But if it opens at $60, I’ve got it covered.\" His broker said, \"You realize that if it opens higher than $60, you won’t be buying a single share.\" Lonny said, \"Yes, but I’m sure it won’t.\" The broker placed Lonny’s order. He gave Lonny a confirmation number. Lonny told his wife, \"We might double our money today! Let’s pray that LinkedIn closes at $90!\" He explained what he had done.",
  "At 4:05 p.m., Lonny checked the news. LinkedIn had closed at $94. \"I can’t believe it! We doubled our money! We bought the right stock at the right time!\" he exclaimed to his wife. They hugged and kissed. They went to a fancy steak house and celebrated. When they got home after dinner, Lonny said, \"Let me check to see exactly how rich we are.\" He looked at his account online. It hadn’t changed. There was still $180,000 in it. He called his broker. \"What’s going on?\" he asked. \"I should have over $300,000 in my account now.\" The broker put him on hold briefly. \"Here’s the problem,\" he said. \"The opening price for LinkedIn was $83. That was WAY above the pre-IPO price. Your limit was $60. You never even got into the game. You didn’t make one cent.",
  "Four people lost their lives last Sunday morning. A man walked into a Long Island drugstore. He and his wife needed painkillers. He shot and killed everyone in the drugstore. Then he stole about 5,000 painkillers. Police arrested him several days later. He was mowing the lawn at his mother’s house. \"Why did he have to kill four people?\" asked Mrs. Smith, the wife of the pharmacist. Mr. Smith was filling in on Sunday for the regular pharmacist. The regular pharmacist had stayed home for Father’s Day. A young woman, Miss Garcia, was assisting Mr. Smith on Sunday. She would have graduated from high school yesterday. An elderly grandfather, Mr. Jones, was picking up a prescription for his ailing wife. A single mother, Miss Evans, was picking up a prescription for her son. She was to get married next month. \"Why did he have to kill ANYBODY?\" wailed Mrs. Smith.",
  "The approaching car was speeding. It was heading east on 32nd Street. Brian was standing on the corner. He couldn’t believe how fast the driver was going. He’s going to kill someone, Brian thought. Somehow the driver missed EVERYBODY standing in the street at 6th Avenue. The car continued speeding until it was out of sight. Brian couldn’t believe it. How had that driver not killed, or even hit, anyone? Brian was angry. He was angry at the driver. He was angry at himself. He hadn’t yelled at the driver. He hadn’t called the police. He hadn’t done anything. Later, he saw a policeman. He told him about the speeding car. \"What should I do next time?\" Brian asked. The policeman said, \"Just call 911. Tell them you saw a reckless driver. Describe the car. Tell them what direction it was heading. They’ll find the car. They’ll get the driver.\"",

  "Bill had a dream one night. In the dream, he died on the day after his 61st birthday. Bill told his brother about his dream. His brother said, \"It was only a dream.\" Bill said, \"It wasn’t just a dream. It was the TRUTH. If you ever have such a dream, you will KNOW that it’s the truth.\" Bill felt free and happy. This dream was the best news of his life. He wouldn’t die for almost 21 more years. Before then, no disease or injury would take his life. He decided to travel all over the world the last three years of his life. He decided to stay divorced. No woman would want to marry a man who was going to die at 61. He decided to do more exciting things. No more golf for me, he thought. It was time to learn how to skydive and ride motorcycles.",
  "Sam took a bus to the cemetery. He went there every month to visit his mom’s grave. This time something was different. Her headstone was missing. He looked around. Where is Mom’s headstone, he wondered. He started to walk around the cemetery. He saw many other visitors. But he didn’t see even one worker. He kept walking around. He reached a rock pile near a dumpster. At least, it looked like a rock pile. He looked more closely. It wasn’t a pile of rocks. It was a pile of headstones. He found his mother’s headstone. It was broken in two. He looked at the two pieces. How dare they break her headstone, he thought. How dare they throw away Mom’s headstone! He carried the two pieces back to her grave. He placed them on top of her grave. He apologized to his mom. I’ll fix this for you, he promised.",
  "He hated doing the laundry. It was such a hassle. Someday, he thought, clothes will be 100-percent paper. Then we can just throw out our dirty clothes. No more washers, no more dryers. No more laundry baskets, no more laundry soap. He went to the laundry room. He washed and dried a week’s worth of laundry. Back in his apartment, he sorted and folded the clean laundry. What’s this, he wondered. One of his wife’s socks was missing. He looked in the laundry basket. He unfolded the towels and sheets. He examined the apartment floor. He went back to the laundry room. He searched the washer and the dryer. He examined the floor and the trash can. He went back to his apartment. When his wife came home, he told her about the missing sock. \"It’s not missing,\" she said. \"I threw it out. It had a hole in it.\"",
  "\"What do you want to do on the Fourth?\" he asked his wife. She said she was up for almost anything. He looked online. A tour company offered boat tours along with double-decker bus tours. It had downtown, uptown, and night bus tours. It had a Hudson River tour. \"We’ll start with a nice boat ride on the Hudson. Then we’ll sightsee Manhattan from the top of a bus,\" he said. She asked him about the weather. \"It’s going to be hot,\" he said. \"July Fourth is always hot.\" She said, \"I mean, what if it rains?\" He said not to worry. \"The buses and boats run in the rain,\" he said. \"Well, I don’t run in the rain,\" she said. \"If it’s raining, you can go by yourself.\" He told her not to worry. \"It never rains on July Fourth,\" he said. \"It would ruin too many church barbecues.\"",
  "His wife asked him to buy her some new socks. \"Make sure they’re 100% cotton,\" she said. \"I don’t want any polyester blends. I don’t like the feel of polyester.\" He went to a couple of stores. They sold only cotton-polyester blends. This errand was going to take longer than he had thought. He finally found a store that sold \"Premium Soft Cotton\" socks. He bought five packages. He took them home. His wife looked at the big print on the front of one package — \"Premium Soft Cotton.\" She opened the package. She took out a pair of socks. She felt them. \"These aren’t 100% cotton,\" she said. He said, \"Of course they are. Look at the big print.\" She asked, \"Did you look at the small print?\" He looked at the back of the package. At the very bottom, in very small print, it said, \"60% Cotton, 40% Polyester.\"",
  "\"Did you hear the news?\" his wife asked. \"They’re doubling the price of a Powerball ticket next year. It’s going to be $2.\" He said, \"Two dollars for one ticket? That’s ridiculous! One dollar is too much already. We never win anything!\" Correcting him, she said, \"We won two dollars last week.\" They had bought 10 tickets last week because first prize was $130 million. \"Are they going to double our chances of winning?\" he asked. \"No,\" she replied. \"They’re going to make second prize worth $1 million. Right now it’s worth $200,000.\" He said, \"Big deal. Our chance of winning second prize is as low as winning first prize. Next year, we’re not going to waste our money on $2 Powerball tickets. Instead, we’ll buy scratchers. They’re only a dollar.",
  "He was tired of mowing his green lawn. He was tired of looking at his green lawn. He was tired of green, period. He looked across the street. He saw a green lawn. All his neighbors had green lawns. Why, he wondered. Is there a law? Must all homes have green lawns? He decided it was time for a change. He dug up his green lawn. He planted vegetables. He planted carrots. He planted tomatoes. He planted squash. He planted cabbage. A month later, he looked at his new lawn. The vegetables were beautiful. They were colorful. He saw orange, red, yellow, and purple. \"Our new lawn not only looks good, but it will taste good,\" he told his wife. Then he got a letter from the city council. It said, \"Your neighbors have complained. Your lawn doesn’t meet city standards. You have 30 days to make it green again.\"",

They stayed the same. Another man started talking. The caption still didn’t change. Then the whole caption disappeared. The first man started talking again. A new caption appeared. But it disappeared instantly. Ian didn’t have time to read even one word before the caption disappeared. Ian got angry. They can put a man on the moon, he thought, but they can’t do captions right.

When?\" The TV station manager replied, \"Please be patient. We are trying to fix the problem.",
  "\"What are you doing?\" his wife asked. He was standing at the bathroom sink. He was filling up a glass with water. \"I’m getting a glass of water,\" he said. \"Oh no, you’re not,\" she said. \"That’s bathroom water. You can’t drink that. Pour it out. Go to the kitchen and get some clean water.\" He laughed. \"Honey, all the water is the same,\" he said. \"You can drink bathroom water, kitchen water, or even shower water if you want. It’s all safe to drink. Remember, you brush your teeth every day with bathroom water.\" She said, \"I just brush with it. I don’t drink it. I spit it out.\" He sighed.

Any guy would be interested in you.\" Lisa suggested that Mona use a Go-Ring. \"What’s a Go-Ring?\" Mona asked. Lisa said, \"Here, I have one. It’s just a green ring. Put it on your finger. Wave it at him when he looks in your direction. Everyone knows that green means ’go.’ He’ll know that you’re interested in him.\" Mona liked the idea. She went to the restaurant. She flashed the ring over and over to the boy. She wiggled her ring finger over and over. Finally, he came over to her. \"Hi,\" he said.",

  "He was at Macy’s. He needed a short-sleeve, silk shirt. He couldn’t find any silk shirts. He did find a linen-cotton blend. This will have to do, he thought. He took the shirt, still on its hanger, to the fitting rooms. A woman directed him into an empty fitting room. He closed the door. He took off his shirt. He wasn’t wearing an undershirt. He had ridden his bike that day. But he hadn’t showered when he got home. His underarms smelled. He took the shirt off the hanger. He unbuttoned it. He tried it on. It was too big. He took it off. He put it back on the hanger. He took it outside. He gave it to the woman. She started buttoning it up. That shirt was going to hang on the racks again.

But then, I’ll have more time to do OTHER things for you.\" He opened the refrigerator. The temperature dial was on 5. He turned it up to 6. \"There, it’s fixed,\" he said. She said thanks. The next day, she said the vegetables were still freezing. He said, \"That’s odd.\" He opened the refrigerator and looked at the dial. Next to the dial, in big letters, was \"9 IS COLDEST.\" Oops, he thought. He turned the dial down to 4. \"There, now it’s fixed,\" he said.",

Once past the first door, people formed into a loose double line. A woman was to Nick’s right. All of a sudden, a man silently cut in front of Nick. Where did he come from, Nick wondered. Why would he cut in line, Nick asked himself. What’s the rush? The library had plenty of books. It had plenty of seats. Nick looked at the man. He was young. Young and rude, Nick thought. He asked the man, \"Why did you cut in line?\" The man ignored him. Nick repeated, \"Excuse me. Why did you cut in line?\" The man turned around. He looked at Nick. \"I didn’t cut in line.

For example, listed under Clothing are types of clothing, such as Sweaters. Listed under Sweaters are types of sweaters, such as V-Neck and Turtleneck. There were only two books. They were used, not new. One was $12, and one was $7. That’s strange, he thought. Why are the prices different? He examined both books carefully. He couldn’t find a single difference between them.

He rode his bike to K-Mart on 34th Street. He walked the bike inside the store. He went to the big elevator. He took it downstairs. He went to the bike section. He took a bicycle pump off the shelf.

It was huge, but it faced an office building. The office building was right across the street. Anyone on the fifth floor could look right into her apartment. She would have to keep the blinds closed.

He called his father. He wasn’t interested, either. He said, \"Life is just the right number of years as it is.\"",

In his last game, batters hit his knuckleball eight times. Sandy said, \"My knuckleball doesn’t dance anymore. I’m not pitching anymore.\"",

They went to the cashier to pay. The cashier was also wearing plastic gloves. She took their money. She gave them their receipts and change. They found an empty table. He asked, \"Do you think they wear the same gloves all day long?\" She said, \"I hope not. They probably put on new ones after they take breaks or use the bathroom.\" He said, \"I bet plastic gloves are as germy as ordinary skin. The only thing good about gloves is that people can’t pick their ears or noses with gloves on.\"",
  "Grandma heard sobbing. She knocked on Nellie’s bedroom door. \"Can I come in, honey?\" Grandma asked. Nellie said yes. Grandma saw Nellie’s wet eyes. She saw tears on her cheeks. She gave Nellie some tissues. Nellie dried her eyes and blew her nose — Honk! \"What’s the matter, honey?\" asked Grandma. Nellie said, \"The junior prom’s in one week. Nobody has asked me to go to it. I’m such a plain Jane. I’ll never be pretty. I’ll never be popular. No boy will ever date me. I’ll never get married. I’m going to die an old maid!\" Nellie started sobbing again. Grandma hugged Nellie. She said, \"Honey, you’re very pretty in your own special way. Don’t be jealous of others. That’s a waste of your time. Find something you love doing, and become good at it. Your passion for that will make you an attractive and happy woman.",
  "He dropped his glasses on the bathroom floor. They didn’t break. They looked okay. A few days later, his right ear started hurting. He took off his glasses. The pain stopped. He put the glasses back on. The pain came back. He went to an eyeglass store. He told the worker his problem. She adjusted the plastic temple for him. He put the glasses on. They felt okay. An hour later, his ear hurt again. The adjustment hadn’t worked. He went to another eyeglass store. The worker adjusted his glasses. That adjustment didn’t work either. His ear was killing him. He took his glasses off every ten minutes to get relief. At home one day, he boiled some water. He put the temple into the water. He bent the temple himself. He tried on the glasses. They felt okay. The next day, they still felt okay. His ear stopped hurting.",
  "The man was walking his dog on the south side of 29th Street. The dog stopped. The man stopped. The dog squatted. It did its business. The man gathered the poop into a plastic bag. He and the dog started walking. Naomi said, \"Excuse me! You’re supposed to curb your dog, you know? That means your dog should pee and poo in the street, not on the sidewalk. Look at that ugly brown stain on the sidewalk.\" He said, \"It’ll wash off in the rain. I’m not going to bring a scrub brush with me to scrape off poo stains.\" She said, \"You don’t have to. Just curb your dog. This beautiful city is an extension of your home. You don’t let your dog poo on your living room floor, do you? Then why do you let it poo on the sidewalk? The sidewalk is part of your extended home.\"",
  "His daughter went off to college. \"Don’t do anything stupid. And don’t follow the crowd,\" he told her. She said, \"Of course not, Daddy. You know how smart and independent I am.\" He crossed his fingers anyway. She came home during Christmas break. She asked, \"Do you remember telling me not to do anything stupid?\" He said, \"You didn’t get married, did you?\" She said no. She turned around. She pulled up her long hair. He saw a tattoo on the back of her neck. It was a red rose. \"What do you think?\" she asked. He said, \"I think it’s stupid. First of all, a tattoo disfigures your body. If God wanted you to have a tattoo, He would have given you a birthmark. Second, why did you get a tattoo that you can’t even see? What’s the point?\" She said, \"That’s where all my dorm mates have theirs.\"",
  "Ivan was standing at the drugstore counter. Something struck his leg. It was one of the store’s small plastic carts. It was empty. Someone had pushed it toward the counter. He was walking downstairs into the subway station. Three teenage girls were walking upstairs. He moved over to the far right side of the stairwell. One teen bumped into him. She kept talking to her friends. He was nearing a turnstile from the left. From the right, a businessman held his briefcase high as he stormed past Ivan. Ivan was riding the narrow escalator down to the platform. A skinny woman wedged her way past him. He sat down at the end of the subway bench. A man approached from Ivan’s right. A big canvas bag hung on his side. He walked straight toward Ivan. At the last second, he veered to his left. The bag scraped across Ivan’s shoulder.",
  "She felt something in her throat. Oh no, she thought. A tiny spot in her throat was burning. She knew what it was. It was the start of a cold. Where did she get it? It was probably the subway, she thought. There’s no telling how many germs are on those metal poles. The next day, her throat not only burned, but it itched. Her nose was stuffed. She had to blow it constantly. She was sneezing and coughing. It hurt her throat to talk. She went to the drugstore. She bought nasal decongestant tablets. Each tablet was good for 12 hours. She bought throat lozenges. She called her boss. She told him she wasn’t coming in to work. She didn’t want to infect everybody. Her boss said, \"Don’t worry about it. If I’m going to get a cold, I’d rather get it from you than from a total stranger.\"",

Let’s try it.\" She said she had never eaten there. He said, \"Well, it’ll be a new taste treat for both of us.\" They waited in line for 30 minutes. He ordered a hamburger, fries, and a shake for each of them. He ordered Shake Sauce. The clerk gave him his receipt and a beeper. Ten minutes later, the beeper went off. He brought their order back to their outdoor table. He dipped a fry into the Shake Sauce. It tasted like Thousand Island dressing. \"This sauce is nothing special,\" he said. A few bites later, she said, \"This meal is nothing special. It’s good, but it’s not worth waiting 40 minutes for. All these people must be tourists.\"",
  "Ned and Jan worked for the Bronx Zoo. They were monkey experts. Elmer was one of twelve monkeys. He didn’t socialize much. Ned and Jan tried occasionally to get Elmer to mate, but he firmly resisted those efforts. \"Maybe he wants prettier females,\" joked Ned. Jan said, \"Maybe females don’t interest him.\" What did interest Elmer was the TV in the monkey cave. Elmer loved to watch Sesame Street. He not only watched, but he listened. \"I think he actually understands the show,\" said Jan. Ned said, \"I think he likes Miss Piggy.\" One day Jan saw Elmer holding a stick. It looked like he was drawing something in the sand. He finished. She went over to see what he had drawn. Maybe it’s a banana, she thought. When she arrived at where he had been drawing, she didn’t see a banana. She saw the words, \"I don’t belong here.\"",

Both of my idiot brothers are boys. Half of my classmates are idiot boys.\" He said, \"Be nice. Don’t call your brothers idiots. Believe me, you’ll change your mind about boys when you get older. And then you’ll thank me for introducing you to golf. But until then, you can learn a lot from golf. Golf will teach you valuable people skills. It will teach you honesty and courtesy. It will teach you perseverance and confidence.\" She said, \"But Daddy, I don’t need to go to a golf course to learn that. I already learned it at home from you and Mom. Besides, soccer is a lot more fun, and there are no boys in our soccer league.\"",

Her mom says she’s looking for a husband.\" Henry said, \"Forget it! I’m not going to date someone who’s desperate to get married.

The app was an avatar. The avatar had her credit card information. It stood in line for her. When it got to the front of the line, it paid her bill. She described her app to her friend. He was a computer programmer. He said, \"First of all, avatars are only in movies and online. It’ll be years before they’re part of everyday life. An avatar can hold your place in line. It can pay using your credit card info. But it can’t carry your packages. If you’re in line at the supermarket, it can’t push the cart. What are you going to do about that?\" She said, \"No problem.

Big fairy wings extended above his shoulders. \"Today and Halloween are the best days of the year,\" he said to a reporter.

They could hear someone yell, \"Hacker!\" They could hear someone yell, \"Go in the water!\" A TV commentator said, \"Well, we are in New York. New Yorkers always speak their mind. They learn that on the city’s mean streets. So their ’frank’ remarks don’t surprise us.\" John was watching TV with a friend. John said, \"That’s not right.

For $59.99, tech support might be able to fix the problem. But, there was no guarantee. He offered to ship Jeff a brand new printer for only $99. \"Shipping is free,\" Brian said. Jeff didn’t know if he wanted another HP printer. \"Thanks, but let me think about it,\" he told Brian. Jeff said goodbye.",
  "Later that afternoon, Earl sent everyone out to take pictures for practice. He said to return by 4:30 sharp. Will and Keesha went to two vacant apartments. Keesha took lots of pictures; Will took only a few. They returned to the training room at 4:27. One student hadn’t returned. Earl asked where Jack was. Keesha said that Jack was outside smoking a cigarette. Will went to the rest room. He came out a couple of minutes later. The training room had glass walls. The sliding glass door was open. Will saw Jack. He was back in the training room. Earl saw Will approaching. \"Walk faster!\" Earl said. Will was amazed. He’s telling me to walk faster from the bathroom to the training room, Will thought angrily. Earl shouted, \"I s-a-i-d, walk faster!\" Will walked slowly into the training room. He shook his fist in Earl’s face. \"Walk this!\" Will said.",
  "Jeff decided to try an older printer that he owned. He hadn’t used it in a couple of years. He dusted it off. He inserted the installation disk. The disk started spinning. The software failed to install. He tried again. It failed again. He called HP Support. Benjamin answered. Jeff described the problem. Benjamin said Jeff’s printer was out of warranty. He said it was almost obsolete. He said tech support might be able to fix the problem for $59. He said Jeff should buy a new printer for only $99. Shipping was free. Jeff said thanks, but he’d think about it. He said goodbye. He called NYC’s 311 number. Laura answered. He told her he had two dead printers. How could he dispose of them? She said, \"Well, until 2015 you can just throw them into your regular trash. But take out the ink cartridges first.\" Jeff thanked her.",
  "It was 8 a.m. It was the first day of training. The trainer, Earl, introduced himself to everyone. Will thought Earl seemed nice enough, at first. As time passed, however, Will’s opinion changed. Earl did not like many of Will’s questions. He said Will’s questions were too negative. Will said his questions were realistic, not negative. Will saw a change in Earl’s responses to his questions. Earl would shake his head before answering. Earl would roll his eyes before answering. Earl would say, \"I s-a-i-d,\" loudly and slowly before answering. Earl would stare at Will silently for a few seconds before answering. Earl would answer sarcastically. One time Earl turned on his computer before answering. He typed and printed out the answer to Will’s question. He silently handed the printed answer to Will. That did it for Will. He had had enough. Earl was not going to disrespect him again.",
  "Jeff went online. He looked at $99 printers. Canon had a Pixma MX410. It was an All-in-One printer. He read the reviews. They were good. Plus, the Pixma was reduced to $79. That would save him $20. It was 9 p.m. Saturday. He had just spent five hours trying to fix two old printers and finding a new printer. Life was a lot simpler when all we had was typewriters, Jeff thought. Sunday afternoon he called the Staples on 35th Street. He asked if they had the MX410. They did. Jeff walked over to the store. The printer was big and heavy. It was also $99. \"I thought it was reduced to $79,\" he told the worker. \"It was,\" said the worker, \"but all our sales end Saturday night.\" Jeff thought about going back online. Was the money he could save worth the extra time? He paid the extra $20.",
  "He had just returned from gambling in Atlantic City. My luck continues, he thought, as he saw a parking space close to his apartment building. He whistled as he parked his car. He lifted his three big suitcases out of the trunk. He put them on the sun-baked sidewalk. He parked one suitcase against his car. He rolled the other two into the lobby. He returned to his car. The suitcase was gone. He looked up and down the street. He looked all around. He called the police. A policewoman asked, \"Why would you leave your suitcase unattended on the sidewalk? People steal suitcases, you know, especially when they have wheels.\" He said, \"Yes, but this is the Upper West Side! It’s quiet! It’s safe! It’s crime free! It’s not at all like where I used to live.\" She asked, \"And where was that?\" He said, \"The Lower East Side.\"",
  "They took a limo to JFK airport. When they arrived, she got out of the limo. She said, \"I already paid the driver to take you back home. I’ve paid for everything.\" An hour later, Melvin gave the driver $20, saying, \"Thanks. Here’s your tip.\" The driver thanked him. Melvin entered his apartment and called his wife. She was still waiting to board her plane. He said he had tipped the driver $20. She said, \"Why? I had already tipped him! I told you I had paid for everything.\" What a greedy driver, Melvin thought. He had accepted two tips for one ride. A month later, Melvin called the driver to get another ride to JFK. The fare alone was $50. When Melvin and his wife arrived at JFK, he gave the driver $50 exactly. Melvin said, \"Remember last time? You accepted two tips for one ride. Now we’re even.\"",
  "On an uncharted island, a scholar was trying to find Amelia Earhart. Instead, she found Pablo. He was skinny and naked. His white hair and beard dragged along the ground. She started asking questions. \"How’d you get here? How long have you been here?\" Pablo said he’d jumped ship when he saw this island. He was tired of being at sea. He was tired of listening to his crewmates. He was especially tired of Ferdinand. \"Ferdinand who?\" she asked. \"Ferdinand Magellan,\" said Pablo. \"He is such a crazy man.\" She was astounded. Magellan and his crew were last in the Pacific about 1521. If Pablo was telling the truth, he was now over 500 years old ! She asked Pablo what he’d been eating all these years. Pablo dug into the wet soil. He showed her a handful of earthworms. \"Just these,\" he said, as he offered her a live worm.",
  "He was at CUNY on Fifth Avenue. It was the presidential election. Would Obama win again? Eight volunteers were inside a small room downstairs. He showed a volunteer his driver license. She couldn’t find his name on her list of registered voters. She sent him to another volunteer. His name wasn’t on her list either. She gave him an affidavit and a ballot. While he was filling out the affidavit, the woman behind him was complaining loudly. She said, \"Why can’t you find my name? You people couldn’t find my name last time either. I’m a registered voter. There must be another list. Have you checked ALL the lists? Why do I have to go through this every time?\" Hurricane Sandy had just destroyed thousands of area homes. Newly homeless families were sleeping in shelters. This woman is crying, he thought, just because she has to fill out an affidavit.",
  "She walked up to the drink machine. She fed it a dollar bill. She pushed the button for a cherry soda. The machine buzzed. Then it said, \"We’re so sorry. We cannot accept your money for this product. It has calories, and you are overweight. Please select a calorie-free product. We suggest you try a bottle of refreshing spring water. That would be button number 4.\" She angrily pushed the button for a cherry soda again. The machine buzzed louder and longer. It said, \"Perhaps you didn’t understand. Please push the button for the language you speak.\" She pushed the Chinese button. The machine continued in English. \"You cannot fool us. We know who you are. We are protecting you from yourself. Please select a calorie-free drink. After you’ve lost 25 pounds, you may push the cherry soda button up to twice a week.\" She kicked the machine hard — twice.",
  "They got on the N train. Jane stood there for a second. Then she spun on her heel and started walking out of the car. Cliff looked around. He saw a little man holding a white Styrofoam cup. Cliff followed Jane out of the car. They entered another car. The train left the station. Cliff asked what the problem was. She said, \"Didn’t you smell him? Sometimes I wish I had your nose.\" The end door opened. The little man entered their car. He mumbled something to nearby riders and held out his cup. Jane quickly walked to the opposite end of the car. Cliff didn’t move for a moment. Then he smelled something. Good grief, he wondered. How can one person smell up a whole car? He walked to the opposite end of the car. At the next stop, they got off that car and waited for another train.",
  "Mason’s brother-in-law David was scheduled for surgery. \"It’s his heart. They’re going to saw through his sternum,\" said David’s wife. \"He’ll be in the hospital for about five days. It’ll take him about five months to recover fully. But he should feel a lot better after surgery. Right now he can’t even walk without huffing and puffing.\" Mason bought a get-well card for David. Then he remembered something. His two other brothers-in-law had been in the hospital within the past two years. They had had surgery too. He hadn’t mailed a get-well card to either of them. If he mailed this card to David, the other two might hear about it. They might feel offended. But if he didn’t mail a card to David, he might feel offended. Mason mailed the card. Hopefully, the other two will get sick again, he thought. Then he could mail them get-well cards too.",

I’ll bet I can scare you.\" He laughed. \"What are you going to do? Jump out of the closet? Wear a scary mask? Nothing will work.\" She said, \"We’ll see who gets scared next week.\" On Halloween night, Jenna took Kyle trick or treating. He was dressed as a construction worker. He even wore steel-toed boots. By 10 p.m., his bag was full of candy. They started walking home. Suddenly, The Joker leaped out of some bushes. Jenna was startled. Kyle was unfazed. \"Give me that bag!\" said The Joker. Kyle kicked The Joker in his shin. He cried, \"Ouch!\" and hobbled away. They continued walking. Kyle said, \"I hope your friend limps for a week.\" Jenna said, \"I have no idea who that jerk was.

I’m new here in Manhattan. Can you tell me where I can buy groceries?\" She said, \"Hi. Sure. There are a few markets in this neighborhood. There’s NSA over on 9th Avenue. There’s Gristedes on 3rd Avenue. There’s Whole Foods on 7th Avenue. There’s Trader Joe’s on 14th Street. There’s Duane Reade on every corner almost. It sells some fresh produce and lots of other food items. And of course there are delis everywhere.\" He said, \"Great. Thanks. Is there any place you recommend?\" She said, \"Yes. Buy your produce from the street vendors. They sell the same produce as the big supermarkets, but much cheaper. That’s probably because their only overhead is an umbrella or two.\"",

He plugged the old player into the 10-year-old TV in the bedroom. His wife came home. She said, \"Why didn’t you just plug the new player into our bedroom TV? You always do everything the hard way.\" He said, \"Because I couldn’t. New DVD players don’t use those cables with the red, white, and yellow pin connectors. They use cables with HDMI connectors, which are rectangular. I can’t plug a rectangular connector into a round hole.\" She said, \"I don’t believe that.\" He said, \"You don’t believe that?

  "A 17-year-old girl in Ohio has \"sleeping beauty\" syndrome. Julie appears to be perfectly normal. She’s an excellent student. She has good friends at school and church. But occasionally, she has spells. During these spells, she sleeps up to 18 hours a day. Her mom says, \"During the other six hours, she walks and talks, but she’s not ’all there.’ She doesn’t even know that she’s having a spell. John and I just watch her to make sure she doesn’t hurt herself. If she wants to go out, one of us always accompanies her. When a spell ends, she remembers none of it. She’s had four spells since she was seven. The first one, of course, scared us half to death. The longest one lasted 60 days. We’ve taken her to several doctors. They say only 1,000 people have it worldwide, so there’s no cure and there never will be.\"",

Married people should sleep in the same bedroom and in the same bed.\" She said, \"Not if one of them sounds like a farm animal.\" He promised her he’d try not to snore so loud. That night, all went well until 5:30 am. She yanked his ear. \"Huh?\" he grunted.

  "Luke entered the classroom. He saw one empty desk. It was the last desk in the far row next to the wall. He walked over to it and sat down. An old man was sitting in front of him. The teacher started talking. Luke started taking notes. The old man moved slightly in his seat. Moments later, Luke smelled something rotten. It was like a rotten egg. It was like sewer gas. It was a fart. The old man had farted. Luke almost gagged. Please let that be the last one, Luke prayed. It wasn’t. The old man farted silently, and constantly, for 50 minutes. Luke tried to breathe through his mouth. Nearby students fanned the air. Class finally ended. Later, Luke told his wife about the gas attack. \"Why didn’t you just get up and leave?\" his wife asked.",
  "Lorna needed some blank CDs. At Staples, she found a Memorex 25-pack for $10. The Memorex label said \"Cool Colors.\" An illustration of a yellow disc and an orange disc was on the label. That’s cool, Lorna thought. She bought the Cool Colors and went home. She opened the pack. The entire label side of the top disc was yellow. She copied audio from her computer to five yellow discs. She used a black Sharpie to write the audio contents on each disc. She took the sixth disc out of the pack. The entire label side was black. What’s this, she wondered. How could she use her black Sharpie to write on a black label? There were five black discs in the pack. Lorna called the Sharpie 800 number and explained her problem. \"I’m sorry, but we don’t make a white Sharpie for CDs,\" said the representative.",

He rapped the touchpad so hard that he startled his wife. She was in the next room. \"Did you drop something?\" she asked. He said his computer wasn’t working right. She asked, \"Why don’t you get it repaired?\" He said it’d cost too much money. She said, \"But you bought a two-year warranty with that computer.\" He said, \"I did? You’re right.

When you were younger, Santa used to be very real for you. You believed in him. Remember how often you left out cookies for him? Telling little kids about Santa isn’t a lie, honey. It’s a tradition. You’ll see — when you have kids of your own.\"",
  "Boris called his cable company. He said, \"Last night I went to sleep with my TV on. This morning the TV was still on, but the screen was black. There was a big, orange rectangle on the screen. It said, ’Weekly Required Test.’ The clock on the cable box said 4:30, but it was actually 7:15. I tried to turn off the TV with the remote. Nothing happened. I tried to turn off the cable box with the remote. Nothing happened. I unplugged the cable box. Then I plugged it back in. But the correct time didn’t appear on the cable box. Instead, numbers appeared. Number one, number two, number three. When the count-up got to 100, it started all over again. It’s still doing it. What’s going on?\" The representative didn’t know. She talked to her supervisor. She told Boris, \"My supervisor says your cable box flunked the test.\"",
  "The unopened box contained a bar of soap. He dug under the end flap with his thumbnail. He couldn’t pry the flap open. He tried to dig under the other end flap. He couldn’t pry that flap open either. This is a simple, cardboard box, he thought. Why is it sealed like Fort Knox? He grabbed a knife and sawed through the box. That’s it, he thought. He was tired of wrestling with packages in order to open them. He went to his basement. After many months of effort, he developed his Instant Opener. He took it to trade shows. Manufacturers loved it. What was it? A quiet, tiny bomb. To activate the bomb, all a customer had to do was pull on a piece of string on the outside of the package. The tiny bomb was just strong enough to open any package. It didn’t even make a mess.",
  "\"My son, the polar bear,\" Dad said. \"Every New Year’s Day, you and a thousand other Coney Island loonies jump into the freezing ocean. How stupid is that?\" Nick said, \"It’s not stupid, Dad. It’s fun, it’s free, and it’s healthy. And we do it every Sunday in the winter, not just on New Year’s Day. Look at what you do every Sunday. You spend $20 for golf balls, which you usually lose, and $50 for greens fees. You stand around for six hours in the heat, cold, or rain waiting for the golfers in front of you to mosey out of the way. And you come home upset because, as usual, you didn’t break 100. Now, how stupid is that?\" Dad said, \"Don’t knock it till you try it.\" Nick said, \"You’re right, Dad. Don’t knock it till you try it.",
  "\"I don’t understand those people in India,\" Lester said. His wife Lucy asked, \"What about them?\" He said, \"They’re hungry. They’re surrounded by millions of cows. But their religion doesn’t allow them to eat cows. It’s crazy to have all that fresh meat and not eat it.\" She said, \"But we do the same thing in America.\" He said, \"I don’t think so. There isn’t a cow in America that we don’t eat sooner or later.\" She said, \"I’m not talking about cows. I’m talking about cats and dogs. How many million strays do we put to sleep every year? First, we put them in shelters. Then, if nobody adopts them, we put them to sleep. Then we bury them, or burn them, or whatever. We should eat them. Pet meat is still meat.\"",
  "Brad walked into Walbrowns. He swiped his rewards card. He said, \"Avatar, appear.\" His avatar appeared. Brad said, \"Unscented deodorant, all brands.\" He followed the avatar down the escalator. The avatar hovered at the deodorant section. It shined a bright light on the shelf containing unscented deodorant. Brad selected a container. He opened the top. He sniffed the contents. He couldn’t detect any scent. This’ll do, he thought. He said, \"Avatar, disappear.\" The avatar disappeared. Thank goodness for avatars, Brad thought. Most stores had avatars now. An avatar could find anything instantly. All a shopper had to do was follow his avatar to each item. Shopping was now a little more pleasure, a little less torture. Progress had finally arrived for befuddled shoppers. Brad took the escalator back upstairs. He groaned at what he saw. A dozen people were standing in line. There were six registers. There were two clerks.",

You two are living alone in that big house. We could help out around there.\" His dad said, \"We don’t need any help. And you should try harder. Do you think I own this house because I was a quitter?

After hundreds of measurements, Lana realized one thing. Stubway’s \"foot longs\" were all less than a foot long. She called her local TV station. A reporter interviewed her. A network TV reporter saw the story. He interviewed Lana. Then he interviewed a Stubway spokesperson.

Mary said, \"What are these people complaining about? Cruise ships are in the news every year. How many times do half the passengers catch a stomach virus? Just last year a cruise ship sank.

She looked down one block to the next intersection, but she couldn’t see a numbered street sign. Looking one block the opposite way, she saw \"West 35th St.\" That direction was north.

Even with a pillow, you can hurt someone if you hit them in the head. You can injure their neck. You can cause nerve damage. You can cause a concussion. They can lose their sight, or hearing, or even their sense of smell. They can lose their memory. They can suffer permanent brain damage. And do you know what’s even worse than all that? It’s the guilt that you’ll feel every day for the rest of  your life for permanently injuring someone, especially if it’s someone you love.\"",
  "May was 15. She was an only child. It was her first visit to Manhattan. Vicky had gone to school with May’s mom 30 years ago. Out of the blue, May’s mom had called. She’d asked Vicky to escort May from JFK to their Manhattan hotel. Vicky met May at the JetRed carousel. Vicky dragged May’s heavy suitcase off the carousel. May asked, \"Could you carry my laptop?\" They left the airport. May’s hands were empty. Vicky carried her purse on her shoulder. She pulled the large suitcase with one hand. She carried May’s laptop in her other hand. They caught the train. They got off the train and walked to the hotel. When they got close, May saw her parents in the lobby. Before they saw her, she took the suitcase and laptop out of Vicky’s hands. May lugged them both through the hotel doors. Her parents hugged her.",
  "A Thai golfer recently won the Malaysian Open on the European Tour. A TV announcer said, \"This is tremendous news for Asian golf. This victory is the first on the European Tour by an Asian golfer. It tells the men’s professional golfing world that Asians have arrived. The Asian Invasion is about to begin.\" His fellow announcer said, \"C’mon! The Asian Invasion started in 1996. That’s when Tiger Woods turned pro. Tiger’s mom is Thai, so Tiger is half-Thai. Tiger is the best Thai golfer and the best Asian golfer in the world.\" The other announcer said, \"First, Tiger is only half-Asian. Second, the fans don’t see a half-Asian Tiger; they see an all-black Tiger. That’s what Tiger will always be. He’s just like President Obama. He’s half-white, but people worldwide see him as all-black. Very few people are color-blind. And most people still judge a book by its cover.\"",
  "On Natalie’s tenth birthday, her mom said, \"Guess what? We’re taking you to the Birthday Parlor. There’ll be free cake, ice cream, karaoke, and games. There’ll be drawings for free prizes. There’ll be free entertainment by magicians and musicians.\" The Birthday Parlor is a huge building in Manhattan next to the Hudson River. Facelook owns the building. It owns Birthday Parlors in all major cities worldwide. Entry is free for the \"birthday boy\" or \"birthday girl,\" who must show a valid ID, and guests.

Birthday celebrants have fun and meet hundreds of other people with the same birthday as theirs.",
  "She was at her counselor’s office. She said, \"I’m not happy. I can’t wait till I die.\" He said, \"Happiness comes and goes. Why waste time thinking about, and seeking, something that’s only temporary? Instead, seek meaning.\" She asked, \"’Meaning’? What does that mean?\" He said, \"Try to make the world a better place. That will give your life meaning. Even picking up a piece of paper on the sidewalk makes the world a better place. When you give more, you’ll actually get more. You’ll feel more fulfilled. Giving won’t cost you anything but your time. And when your time is occupied with giving, it won’t be occupied with crying. Your life will have purpose. You’ll begin every day asking yourself, How can I help out today? Having meaning in your life won’t make you happy, but you’ll stop feeling like a tiny cork floating on a giant ocean.\"",
  "He needed money. He went to a crowd-funding website. On it, anyone could try to raise money for any purpose. His purpose was: \"Give me a million dollars, and I’ll burn it all in Union Square. The bonfire will show our contempt for cash and greed.\" A year later, site visitors had donated a million dollars. His friend asked, \"Well, when are you going to burn it?\" He said, \"Burn it? Who would burn a million bucks? I’m going to buy myself a condo.\" She said, \"But you made a deal with the donors. They did their part; now you must do your part.\" He said, \"Forget it! If I’d known I’d collect a million, I wouldn’t have offered to burn it.\" She said, \"You’re not keeping your part of the bargain. How can you live with yourself?\" He said, \"I’m a millionaire now. It’s easy to live with myself.\"",

  "He was sitting on a crowded B train. He was wedged between two other passengers. He had no wiggle room. He felt his right leg tingling. It was going to sleep. He knew, if he just stood up before his stop, his leg would slowly wake up. But he remained sitting. Five minutes later, the train pulled into his station. He stood up. From sole to hip, he couldn’t feel any part of his right leg. As best he could, he quickly hobbled out of the train and onto the platform. He felt a sharp pain in his right knee. He must have put too much weight on the knee, which he had injured years ago in a skiing accident. He immediately took the northbound B train home. His knee was killing him. He hobbled straight to bed. Once again, he thought, I’ve paid the price for ignoring common sense.",
  "He had a ground-floor, one-bedroom condo in lower Manhattan. The news about the coming hurricane was frightening. He asked his sister if he could stay in her studio apartment for a day or so. She welcomed him in. The hurricane was even worse than had been predicted. Water flooded his condo. His building had no power for four months. His sister put up with him all that time. When he finally moved back into his condo, she said, \"I’m so glad you’re leaving.\" He said, \"Me, too.\" A few months later, she called him. She said, \"I need a favor.\" He said, \"Anything. I owe you big-time.\" She said, \"My youngest son Jerry, your nephew, just transferred to NYU. He needs a place to live until he graduates in two years.\" He said, \"Two years?! C’mon!

  "The subway car was crowded, but she managed to find a seat. An unkempt old man with a beard was sitting next to her. He was reading a newspaper. On the floor, between his feet, was a dirty-looking bag. Well, at least he doesn’t smell, she thought. The man was reading the newspaper almost at arm’s length. Because his seat was perpendicular to hers, his left hand was close to her face. He turned the pages rapidly. He brought his hands together and then extended them each time he turned a page. She felt uncomfortable. She worried that his hand might accidentally touch her face. She was about to stand up. But then, he folded the paper neatly. Thank goodness, she thought. He opened his bag and put the paper in it. She looked in. She saw at least a dozen more newspapers. He pulled one out. She stood up.",

Besides, we’re flying over the Pacific. I can’t swim.\" He said, \"Swim? Ha! One, if we crash into the ocean, the crash will probably kill you. Two, even if you could swim, sharks can swim faster. Three, this plane has plenty of life vests. If you’re lucky enough to survive a crash with your life vest on, you can just relax. You’ll float like a beach ball.\" She said, \"OK. Then what?\" He said, \"Then what? What do you think? You’re in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Nobody’s going to find you and rescue you. You’ll probably die a slow death from thirst or exposure.

  "He was watching TV. The commercials started. One after another they came, like subway riders going through turnstiles. Five minutes later, the program resumed. Ten minutes later, a new cluster of commercials started. Five minutes later, the program resumed. During this part of the program, he saw three new commercials at the bottom of his TV screen. Then, a new cluster of commercials began. He said, \"This is getting ridiculous. It’s bad enough that we already get one minute of commercials for every two minutes of programming. But now, they’re sneaking in commercials during the program at the bottom of the screen.\" His son said, \"That’s the price you pay for free TV. But you ain’t seen nothing yet. Guess what’s around the corner? They’re developing hologram TV. The pitchmen for commercials will come out of the TV.",
  "The teacher asked his twelfth-grade students to name the most important invention. Among other things, they named the Internet, computers, smart phones, bicycles, and light bulbs. They named fishhooks, sewing machines, clocks, electric guitars, cat litter, and indoor plumbing. He asked, \"Now, which is most important to you?\" They voted. Smart phones were most important. He said, \"Okay. I want all of you to promise me one thing. Promise not to use any bathrooms or water fountains for the next 24 hours. If you need a drink of water, go to the river. If you need to wash or bathe, go to the river. If you need to go to the bathroom, go to the river.\" The students groaned. The teacher asked, \"Shall we vote again?\" Peter said, \"No. We got it. Indoor plumbing isn’t sexy, but it’s better than all the other inventions combined.\" The others murmured and nodded.",

Zilch.\" His daughter said, \"But news about Hurricane Sandy helped us prepare for it. That was important.\" Daniel said, \"Yes, it was. But strictly speaking, that wasn’t news — it was the weather. The weather does affect us personally. It is important. But news has little value except as entertainment. It’s something to talk about. It’s not personal. Media news is about what happens to others.

So that explained the two red marks on his forearm. He flushed the bedbug down the toilet. He took the quilt and sheet off the bed. He examined the mattress and bed frame. He went back into the bathroom. That bedbug had somehow clung to the quilt when he shook it. Maybe it had survived the flush. It hadn’t. He flushed anyway. From that day on, he checked the pillows, sheet, and quilt thoroughly before going to bed and before making the bed. He didn’t get bitten again, but his worry didn’t go away.

Over the years, however, the bags in the bins had become disorganized. He didn’t know which plastic bags were in which bins. He didn’t even know which things were in which plastic bags.

  "As a youth, Cal was a bully and a thief. One time, he stole a man’s wallet. The man grabbed him. Cal punched the man hard. Cal ran, but the police caught him. A judge sentenced Cal to two years in jail. He was released after only six weeks. Ten years later, Cal was rich and famous. His victim phoned him. The victim said, \"Ten years ago, you stole my wallet. Then you punched me in the face. I lost all the vision in my left eye. Back then, you were poor. Now you’re rich. I think you owe me a lot of money.\" Cal said, \"I don’t owe you squat. You shouldn’t have grabbed me. You tried to be a hero. Because of you, I spent six weeks behind iron bars. I’ll never forget my time in that cell. I paid my debt to society, and society includes you.\"",
  "He was on the Q train. At Union Square, two women got on the train. They sat directly across from him. They were attractive women. They looked very much alike. He went back to his magazine. The train stopped at Herald Square. They got up. He got up. He asked the older-looking woman, \"Mother and daughter? Or sisters?\" She smiled and said, \"Hello, Henry, how are you doing? This is my daughter, Liz.\" He smiled at Liz and said hello. Both women got off the train. He did too. He was baffled. The woman acted as if she knew him well. She was talking to her daughter on the platform. He wanted to ask, \"Forgive me, please, but how do you know my name? Where did we ever meet?\" But he walked past her. He climbed the stairs to the street. Maybe, if he ever saw her again, he’d ask.",
  "She walked into the bedroom. Her husband was sitting at his desk. Two of his fingernails were pinching at his face. She said, \"You’re pulling out your whiskers again! You promised me you were going to stop doing that.\" He said, \"Yes, I did promise you. And this is the last time, I swear. I won’t pull any more hair out of my face. I’ll use only my razor to remove my whiskers.\" She said, \"You said that nine months ago. But nothing’s changed. It’s not like I’m asking you to quit drinking or smoking. All I’m asking you is this one little thing. And you refuse to do it. That shows me that you don’t respect me.\" He said, \"I do respect you. But this habit has got a hold of me. It won’t let go of me.\" She said, \"No, it’s you who won’t let go of it.\"",
  "He and his coworker, Sheila, were at Shake Shake in Brooklyn. They had both ordered cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes. He had ordered a coffee shake. She had ordered a chocolate shake. Their buzzer sounded. He went to the pick-up counter. He brought their orders back to their table. The cups containing the shakes were identical. Neither cup was marked Chocolate or Coffee. He didn’t know which one was his. He removed the lids from both cups. He looked at the shakes. One was light brown. The other was lighter brown. He asked, \"Which one’s coffee?\" Sheila didn’t know. He took both shakes back to the counter. He asked a worker, \"Can you help me? Which one’s coffee, and which one’s chocolate?\" The worker studied the shakes. Pointing, she said, \"This one’s coffee.\" He asked, \"How can you tell?\" She said, \"Because it looks more like coffee than the other one.\"",
  "He said, \"Maybe someday we’ll have a big house and a big yard. Then maybe we can have some pets, too.\" She said, \"I don’t want any pets.\" He asked, \"Why not?\" She said, \"When I was four, I had a beautiful white kitten. It got into bed with me one night. I had already gone to sleep. I rolled over on it. The next morning, I found it lying dead in my bed. Then I had a German shepherd. Her name was Lassie. I loved her so much. But my father said she barked too much. He put her in his car. He drove her to his brother’s farm 50 miles away. Three months later, Lassie showed up at our home. She was so skinny and weak. I was thrilled to see her again. But my father wasn’t. He put her in the car. I never saw her again.\"",
  "He had just bought a used floor lamp. He carried it downstairs to his apartment. He put it on the floor. It wobbled. He banged it down to fix the wobbling. It still wobbled. He lifted it. Big and small chunks of sand-like filler lay on the floor. No filler remained in the base of the lamp. It couldn’t stand upright. His wife said, \"I bet you didn’t look at the bottom of the lamp before you paid for it, did you? How could you forget to look at the bottom?Remember that mattress you bought when you were single? You looked at the top side, but not the bottom. When you got home, you discovered the huge pee stain. We need to have a baby soon.\" He asked, \"A baby? What’s a baby got to do with a lamp?\" She said, \"A baby will teach you to check bottoms.\"",
  "The red, metal box was half the size of a red brick. The box was attached to the wall near the principal’s desk. A thin, glass rod was attached, horizontally, to the front of the box. Embossed red letters on the top of the box said, \"Fire Alarm.\" Embossed white letters on the front said, \"Pull in Case of Fire.\" Leo, 4, had been learning how to read at home. He recognized the word Pull. He pulled. A loud bell immediately started ringing. Leo jumped. Crying, he ran to his mom. She hugged him. She told him not to worry. Three fire trucks arrived. Six firemen in full gear walked inside. Leo started crying again. One fireman said, \"Here, son, try on my hat.\" Leo grinned. His mom took pictures of Leo with the fireman’s hat on. Leo started crying again when the fireman left, taking his hat with him.",
  "Her son was upset. He hadn’t gotten a bicycle for his birthday. His mom said, \"We’ll give you one next year, I promise. Next year you’ll be bigger, stronger, and smarter. All of those things will help you be a better bike rider. And you’ll be safer too. We don’t want you to end up in the hospital. Remember going to the hospital to see Grandma? You don’t want to be in a hospital like her, do you?\" He said, \"No way. Grandma went to the hospital, and then she was dead. The hospital killed her.\" His mom said, \"No, the hospital tried to save her. Cancer is what killed Grandma.\" He asked, \"Did Grandma get cancer from riding a bike?\" His mom said, \"Of course not.\" He said, \"So, if you let me ride a bike now, I won’t get cancer and I won’t end up in a hospital.\"",
  "His wife asked, \"Where’s my goodbye kiss?\" He said, \"No time.\" He got on the elevator. Please be express, he prayed. It wasn’t. He dashed outside. He rushed to the nearby train station, bumping into one person. He started down the station steps. An old lady was shuffling down the steps. Why are old people allowed out in the morning, he wondered. Inside the station, he hurried past the free daily newspapers in the metal racks. He swiped his Metro card. Please don’t tell me to swipe again, he thought. Many people were climbing the stairs from the platform. Which train had they just gotten off? He squeezed past them all. He was finally on the platform! But it was emptier than usual. He looked south. He didn’t see any red taillights. He looked north for his train. He stared hard. Staring hard always works. Every commuter knows that.",
  "She was a little frazzled. Among other problems, a flower company had been billing her incorrectly. She called her bank. She told the rep about the problem, but he wasn’t any help. She told him to cancel that credit card. She went out to lunch several hours later. That evening, she was paying bills online. She said, \"Oh, no! I paid for lunch with my canceled credit card!\" Her husband asked, \"Are you sure? How could a restaurant accept a canceled card?\" She didn’t know. She called the restaurant. It was closed. She sent a lengthy email. She apologized and promised she would drop by the next day to pay for lunch. Later, as she digging through a pile of receipts, she found the receipt for lunch. She had paid for lunch with a good credit card, not a bad one. She emailed the restaurant again. \"Never mind,\" she wrote.",
  "On Planet Harmony, two Earthlings were talking. Nathan had just arrived from Earth. Simon said, \"I’ve been here for almost a year. I had heard about this place for many years. It always sounded too good to be true. But it’s all true. People here are so nice! They’re never negative. They’re never mean or impolite. They’re always friendly and helpful.\" Nathan said, \"That’s exactly why I decided to move here. Hey, maybe you and I can do something together this weekend?\" Simon said, \"I’m afraid I can’t. You see, I’m returning to Earth tomorrow.\" Nathan asked, \"For a little vacation, or what?\" Simon said, \"Actually, for good. Frankly, I miss Earth. I know this sounds crazy, but I miss the jerks and idiots on Earth. Planet Harmony is just too much sugar. I need to yell at someone. I need someone to yell at me. I need some spice.\"",
  "Ernie took the Q train to Brooklyn. He wanted to see what Barclays Center, the new arena, looked like up close. He walked up the stairs from the station. He looked at the building. It didn’t look new; it looked old. It looked like it was covered with rusty, iron plates. It had a weird shape. He crossed the street. There was a huge hole in part of the arena’s roof. He examined the plates. They weren’t rusty, just brown. He called his brother. He told Grady about the plates. Grady said, \"You know why they did that? Because when you make it look old in the first place, you don’t have to worry that it might look old in the future. That’s why some guys marry fat, homely women. That way, they never have to worry about their wife becoming fat and homely down the road.",
  "He wanted to use his thumb drive. He always kept it in his left pants pocket. He started digging around in that pocket. He couldn’t feel the drive. Nothing is ever easy, he thought. He emptied his pocket. He put everything on the desk, but there was no thumb drive. He dug into his right pants pocket. He couldn’t feel it there, either. He emptied the pocket. There were pens, pencils, and keys, but no thumb drive. He stopped looking for it. He figured he’d find it later, when he was looking for something else. The next day, while looking for his pocketknife, he found his thumb drive. It was in his jacket pocket. He wondered how many hours of his life he’d spent looking for his personal things. He always felt like he’d spent half his life looking for things he’d spent the other half of his life misplacing.",
  "He went into the bedroom closet. He grabbed his pants and a shirt. He put them on the bed. Then he took his shoes and socks out of the closet. He put the socks next to the shirt. He took off his glasses. He put them on the bed next to his socks. He pulled his T-shirt over his head. He sat down on the bed. He put on his pants and socks. He stood up. He groaned. His glasses lay squashed on the bed. He had been sitting on them. Miraculously, they were not broken. The soft quilt and mattress had helped protect them from breaking. But they were badly bent. He adjusted the temples and nosepieces. He tried the glasses on. He made many more adjustments. Finally, his glasses fit okay. He made a mental note to himself: The bed is a stupid place to put your glasses.",
  "The number of fans attending Yankees games this spring has decreased from last year. In a TV interview, a Yankees spokesman listed various reasons for the decreased attendance. He said, \"Well, first of all, there’s the weather. Spring has been cold and rainy. In fact, most people would say that we haven’t even had a spring yet. We were still having winter weather in mid-May. Next, our sluggish national economy is hurting attendance. Then, of course, two of our star players are injured. Plus, many fans are watching NBA and NHL playoffs.\" Watching the interview with his dad, Irwin said, \"He gave us every reason but the real one. Prices! Every year ticket prices and concession prices go up.",

Her eyes are a little too close together. But it’s interesting, isn’t it? A pretty woman is a pretty woman all over the world. It doesn’t matter what part of the world she comes from. Pretty is pretty. Why is that? How can men all over the world agree that a pretty woman is a pretty woman? She might be an 8 to some, a 9 to some, or a 10 to others, but we all agree that she’s pretty.\" Howard said, \"That’s easy. It’s in our genes.

  "Justin got off the R train at Whitehall Street in downtown Manhattan. After climbing one flight of stairs, he climbed three more. He stopped to catch his breath and study the city map on the station wall. It showed that the MTA Service Center was nearby on Stone Street. A sign on the station wall said, \"To Stone St.\" He walked up two more flights of stairs. He was at a street corner, but he didn’t see a sign. One block south, he saw a sign saying Bridge St. One block north, he saw a sign saying Bowling Green. Nowhere did he see a sign saying Stone St. A street vendor was selling ties at the corner. Justin asked him where Stone Street was. He said, \"You’re almost standing on it.\" He pointed up. Justin looked up — way up. About 10 feet above his head, a sign said, \"Stone St.\"",

And massaging them didn’t help a bit.\" Sister said, \"You should drink a small glass of salt water. That works great for me. In fact, it’s like a miracle. Seconds after drinking it, I have no cramps at all. How can salt water get down into my feet so fast?\" Brother said, \"I don’t know. Maybe blood circulates at 100 miles per hour or something. All I know is that the pain from cramps is unbearable. When my feet cramp, I sometimes wish I could just chop them off.\" Sister said, \"It wouldn’t help.

  "He was watching TV. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw something. It was a shadow. It seemed to be on the floor. He turned his head to get a better look. Whatever it was, it wasn’t there anymore. Over the next few months, he saw the shadow several more times. It was always out of the corner of his eye. He visited an eye doctor. The doctor examined him. He said, \"There’s nothing wrong with your eyes. Maybe it’s just your imagination.\" He figured the doctor was right. He went home. He was changing channels on his TV. He saw the shadow again. He turned his head quickly. It looked like something went under the bed. He looked under the bed. He realized that it hadn’t been his imagination at all. The shadow was real. Standing there motionless — was it looking at him? — was a big cockroach.",

He asked her many questions. He ordered blood, urine, and stool samples. A week later, Becky and her mom returned to his office. He said, \"Well, Becky’s not lying to you. Her body is actually making its own nutrients. It’s a rare, but temporary, condition. It’s called ’utensilosis.’ She should start eating again in about a year. Don’t worry about it.

It’s simply a matter of being confident. Women like confidence. I meet women just by introducing myself. I smile, I say hello, and I tell them my name. Usually, they smile back, they say hi, and they tell me their name. That’s it. It all starts with a smile, a hello, and a name. Those three things get the ball rolling. After that, it’s all downhill. Frankly, I think you’re wasting your time if you’re looking for women right now.

He spent two days in bed. Then he started using his cane to get around. He felt lucky he had bought the cane when he did. The timing had been just right.

  "People will argue forever about who the world’s greatest golfer is. But nobody can argue about who sank the most important putt ever made in the history of golf. It was Germany’s Martin Kaymer. He sank a 5-foot putt on the last hole of the 2012 Ryder Cup tournament. That pressure-packed putt secured the cup for the European team. In 1991, Germany’s Bernhard Langer missed a 6-foot putt on the last hole of the Ryder Cup. That infamous putt gave the cup to the U.S. team. Langer’s miss still grieves him. Kaymer’s putt was important, of course, for Kaymer. But it was more important for Europe. And it was most important for Germany.

Of course, I don’t want to hurt my credit rating with a late payment. But I’d rather not pay until I see exactly what I’m paying for.\" He said, \"I understand. We can mail you your statement again. It’ll take seven to ten business days.\" Molly said, \"That’s too long. Then I’ll be in the next cycle. Can’t you email me the statement?\" He said, \"We don’t email statements. But we can fax you your statement.\" Molly said, \"Great! Fax it right now. After I check it, I can pay you while we’re still on the phone.\" He said, \"Well, there’s a problem with that. You see, our faxes take three to five business days.\"",
  "An old, thin woman was slowly walking down the subway station steps at 57th Street. She had a bulky, cloth-covered cart. She put the cart on the step below her. Then she walked down to that step. Then she put the cart on the next step below her. Then she walked down to that step. She was about 30 steps from the turnstiles. Wally watched her slow descent as he walked up the steps. They were the only two people in the stairwell. Wally thought, It’s Thanksgiving Day. I’ll give her something to be thankful for. When they met, he asked, \"Can I help you?\" She said, \"Oh, thank you so much, dear.\" He carried the cart to the bottom of the steps. He walked back up the steps. She thanked him again. He watched her until she made it down to her cart. Someday, he thought, that’ll be me.",
  "Several students at a California school complained about their English professor. They complained because she corrected errors in their papers. She corrected their capitalization. She corrected their punctuation. She corrected their spelling. The students belonged to a minority group called Colors United. They said the professor was racist. They said her corrections were acts of micro-aggression. They said her corrections created a hostile class environment. They asked her to stop correcting their papers. She refused. They asked the school president. He refused. CU sued the school. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision, the Court sided with the students. Immediately, most schools nationwide ordered their English teachers to stop correcting students’ errors. Not satisfied, CU launched another lawsuit. This one was against the school’s math department. Said a CU spokesman, \"Why does two plus two always have to equal four? That sounds racist to us.\"",
  "Bob and Ray were talking about the recent train wreck. A passenger train bound for Grand Central Station had crashed at a curve. Ten people were injured. One person died. The engineer was unhurt. At first, the engineer said the brakes had failed. Authorities grilled him. Days later, he admitted that he had dozed off. Bob said, \"He should go to jail for murder.\" Ray said, \"You can’t jail someone for dozing off. Instead, they should take him to Bellevue Hospital.\" Bob said, \"What on earth for? He didn’t get a single scratch.\" Ray said, \"He’s a man without a backbone. He needs an implant. Maybe then he’ll start owning up to his mistakes. He revealed a dark side to friends and family. They’d thought he was an honorable man. But when he lied to cover his butt, he showed his true colors. I mean, his true color — bright yellow.\"",
  "Bernard said to his sister Barb, \"It’s so hard to get to sleep at night. When I finally do get to sleep, I wake up an hour or two later. Then I can’t get back to sleep again. All I think about is past mistakes. Things I should have done. Things I shouldn’t have done. Things I should’ve said. Things I shouldn’t have said. To stop thinking about the past, I try thinking about the future. But when I think about the future, all I do is worry. Will I lose my job? Will I lose my health? Will I lose my mind?\" Barb said, \"Well, instead of thinking about the past or future, why don’t you think about the present?\" Bernard said, \"Ha! When I think about the present, all I think about is my boss, The Jerk.",
  "Every year he mailed his only grandchild, Melissa, a Christmas check. Every year he enclosed a note. It said, \"Please tell me when you get this check.\" Every year she ignored his note. Every year he had to call and ask, \"Did you get my check?\" This year he decided to do something different. This year he \"forgot\" to sign the check. Two weeks passed. He called. He asked, \"Did you get my check?\" She said, \"Yes, but you didn’t sign it.\" He asked, \"Well, why didn’t you tell me?\" She said, \"Because, Grandpa, I knew you’d call. Every year you send me a check and a note. Every year I ignore your note. Every year you call me.\" She said she loved him. They said goodbye. He wrote her another check and mailed it — without the note. Someday, he smiled, you’re going to have a granddaughter just like yourself.",

Superman!\" Superman’s red cape had a big yellow \"S\" on it. He was wearing a blue T-shirt, red slacks, and black sneakers. Billy said, \"That isn’t Superman, Mom.\" Superman was wearing a backpack. A silver chain connected the backpack to a one-gallon plastic jug. He’d taped copies of one-dollar bills all over the inside of the jug. Superman walked throughout the car, holding out his jug for donations. When he finished, he went over and stood at the car door. Billy said, \"Look at him standing by the door.\" Mom said, \"So?

  "His reliable Remington XLR3000 shaver died. It was 10 years old. The rechargeable battery wouldn’t hold a charge. He ordered a new battery online. The instructions that came with it said a soldering iron was necessary. He’d never used one before. He bought one cheap at RadioHut. The battery instructions didn’t tell him how to open the shaver case. It looked bulletproof. He didn’t want to damage the shaver trying to open it. So he let everything sit in his desk drawer — for almost a year. Finally, he decided to take a chance. Working ever so carefully, he managed to pry the shaver apart, solder the new battery into place, and reassemble the shaver. After charging it overnight, he turned it on. It came to life, roaring like a leaf blower! He grinned. He had done something that he thought he couldn’t do. And, he had resurrected his old friend.",
  "Chris was seated in the theater. Nobody was near him. \"Reservoir Dogs 2\" was about to start. As usual, there were few moviegoers at the 12:20 matinee. Chris liked it like that. The lights went down. The previews began. Minutes later, a man and woman sat down in the seats right in front of Chris. He moved a few seats to his left. Then he heard a phone ring. The man started talking on his phone. Chris said, \"Would you please take your phone conversation outside? I’m trying to watch a movie.\" The man looked at Chris. He snarled, \"Go sit somewhere else, old man.\" He threw a full bag of popcorn at Chris. The man resumed talking on his phone. Chris shot the man in the head.

Let’s just go out.\" She said, \"No. Making something shows more love than buying something.\" On Christmas day, he read the instructions for cooking a rack of lamb. He cooked it for 20 minutes. Then he stuck a meat thermometer into it. The thermometer said 180 degrees — very well done. That was fast, he thought. He took the lamb out of the oven. He cut into it. The meat was almost raw. He returned it to the oven. I’ll give it another 30 minutes, he thought. Thirty minutes later, he smelled something burning. The lamb was toast. He told his wife, \"I’m sorry.

The woman at the front of the line held onto one end of the rope. The woman at the back of the line held onto the other end of the rope. The kids look so cute, William thought. He considered taking a picture of them. He’d send it to the local paper.

Hayley looked at the jam-packed cart. She said, \"Oh, no, you don’t. You’re in that line. You stay in that line. You’re not cutting in line in front of me.\"",
  "Brandon’s mom said, \"It seemed like his only joy in life was finding fault. He loved to complain.\" His first girlfriend said, \"At first, he seemed normal. But the more we were together, the more he complained. Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore.\" Girlfriend after girlfriend left him. The frequent breakups gave him plenty of time to think. And the more he thought, the more he realized that it wasn’t just him — everyone complains. Everywhere he went, he heard people complaining — about everything. Maybe there was money in complaining. He set up a website and an 888-COMPLAIN call center. For a dollar a minute, people could complain their hearts out. Unlike in real life, the hired listeners actually listened. They actually cared. They actually sympathized. Complainers were delighted. The people who used to have to listen to the complainers were delighted. So was Brandon, the former complainer — and new millionaire.",

I can’t wait till I’m a grownup. Till I have my own place. Drive my own car. Watch TV or DVDs every night. Go out to clubs.\" Her dad said, \"Be careful what you wish for. Later in life, you’ll probably remember your school years as some of the best years of your life. Growing up with all your friends. Having summer vacations every year.

In the future, you might be wishing that you were back in school again.\" Lorraine said, \"Humph! I’ll never wish that!\" Her dad said, \"Also, honey, never say never.\"",

Thousands of people visit the Charging Bull downtown every day. They hug it and kiss it. They sit on it. They take pictures of it. People will do the same thing if we have a Big Apple.\" Artists worldwide submitted their ideas to the mayor’s office. The mayor presented his five favorite ideas to New Yorkers. They voted for their favorite. A year later, Mademoiselle Gaga la Pomme installed a beautiful, gold-plated apple in Times Square. Five feet tall, it was a huge hit with tourists and natives. They kissed it. They hugged it. They sat on it. They photographed it. They loved it. Finally, the Big Apple had what it was.",

The last time you two were here, there were more horses on the streets than there were cars.

You’ll both have heart attacks — Dad from going around in circles, and you from yelling at him to stop going around in circles. Why not just fly?\" Mom said, \"You know very well why not.

She sat on the examining table, next to a big, silver cabinet on wheels. It had eight drawers. The doctor put on a grimy head mirror. He grabbed two loose exam gloves lying on the bottom of a messy drawer. She looked around the room, but nowhere did she see a box of fresh exam gloves. He put on the gloves. He picked up an otoscope. He didn’t wipe its plastic tip with an alcohol pad. She could feel the dirty tip as he peered into both her ears. He picked up another instrument. He heated its tip with a paper match. She had never seen a doctor do this. She wondered, Is this doctor for real? Saying, \"Excuse me,\" she left the office.",

He saw basketballs floating in some liquid in glass cases. He saw a green statue of the Hulk with part of a piano keyboard glued to his chest. He saw ordinary kitchen sponges sitting on a shelf. Upon leaving 30 minutes later, Howard stood outside. He asked someone, \"Ticket for $10, half price?\" The stranger bought Howard’s ticket.",
  "The chainsaw woke Harry up at 8 a.m. Across the street, a man was cutting the trunk of a felled tree into three-foot long sections. Harry walked over to the kitchen table. He looked into the concave side of a hand mirror. He examined his wrinkled face, as he did almost every morning. He looked for fresh pimples. He saw a big, red \"pimple\" on his neck. An insect had bitten him in his sleep. He looked at the dry skin that had accumulated overnight. He picked the bigger flakes off his face. He licked his index finger and rubbed away the dry skin on his eyebrows. With tweezers, he pulled a few new hairs from his ears. He shook his head. Some day, he wouldn’t be able to do these simple, self-grooming tasks. When that day came, he hoped that he also wouldn’t care about doing these simple tasks.",
  "\"You’re such a loser,\" she said. \"Look at you. You’re white. You were born in America. Your native language is English. You’ve even got a graduate degree. You’ve got all the ingredients for success. But you have nothing. You have the tiniest pension. You’re not even collecting Social Security, because you’re going to wait until you’re 70. Ooh, that’s going to be a lot of money — what, maybe $1,000 a month? Look at all the successful white guys that are your age — George Bush, Bill Clinton. But not you. You have a little part-time job. You’re always applying to agencies for extra work, and they’re always ignoring you. What happened to you?\" He said, \"I don’t know. I made a lot of bad choices. Now I have to live with them.\" She said, \"Yes, I made a bad choice too — marrying you. But I don’t have to live with it.\"",
  "It was 7:30 a.m. He bolted awake. His leg had \"locked up\" right down to his toes. His foot pointed downward, as if he were dancing in a ballet. The pain, which he felt mostly in his cramped calf and foot, was agonizing. His face contorted. In the past, sometimes he could stand on his pointed foot. His body weight would force the foot back to its natural position. In the past, sometimes drinking salt water relieved the cramping. Now, nothing worked, except time. He waited. After 15 seconds, the muscles in his leg and foot relaxed. The pain went away. He breathed a sigh of relief. The \"attacks\" had gotten more frequent over the past year and were lasting longer. They mostly occurred early in the morning. His wife was looking at him. He said, half-joking, \"In another year or so, I guess I won’t need an alarm clock.\"",
  "An off-duty NYPD officer crashed into a parked car late Sunday night. He was charged with drunk driving. He was the fourth officer in four months so charged. Police Commissioner Ratten said, \"Drinking and driving is stupid. This has got to stop. Officers should be model citizens. As commissioner, I’m fixing this problem once and for all. Starting Monday, NYPD will hire teetotalers only. Next month, all officers who are problem drinkers will enter rehab. If  they don’t successfully complete the program, I’ll ask them to resign. If they don’t resign, I’ll fire them. Next year, all officers who drink, but aren’t problem drinkers, will have to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings weekly. That way, they won’t become problem drinkers.\" A reporter said, \"Sir, what about the hazards of tobacco? Are you going to allow NYPD officers to continue smoking?\" Ratten said, \"Of course. Cigarettes don’t make you do anything stupid.\"",
  "The Manhattan district attorney charged managers of two construction firms with fraud. They had hired laymen to inspect construction sites. The laymen signed safety logs using real inspectors’ names. However, one layman used the name of an inspector who’d recently died. Alerted to that forgery, DA officials inspected logs at a few hundred construction sites. They found many more forgeries. An official said, \"It’s a miracle that nobody’s been injured. They hired anyone and everyone to be ’inspectors.’ They hired waiters, busboys, cooks, cashiers, hairdressers, roofers, and lifeguards. Those guys wouldn’t know a safety violation from a safety pin.\" Watching the TV news, Bob said, \"I don’t know. Maybe I’d trust a roofer or a lifeguard. But I always worry when I walk under construction scaffolding. Do they have an inspector for that?\" Ray said, \"Of course not.",
  "A tattoo artist was bored with his job. \"It’s the same old skin every day,\" Leon told his wife. She said, \"Well, maybe you should find another job.\" He said, \"No, I like my job. I just want to spice it up a bit.\" She said, \"Maybe you should find new customers. Check out the churches. Start tattooing deacons and ministers. Start tattooing baptized babies.\" He said, \"Been there, done that.\" She said, \"Maybe you should start tattooing body parts you’ve never tattooed before.\" He said, \"No, I’ve tattooed every part of the human body.\"",
  "The NYC agency application form was an inch thick. He came to one page that had a space for a notary public to sign. He called up the agency. The department supervisor answered. He asked, \"Do I need to get page 21 notarized before I come in for my interview?\" She said, \"No. There are three pages, not just page 21, that need a notary’s signature. We’ll take care of that here in the office when you come in for your interview.\" He asked, \"Okay, so I don’t need to get anything notarized before my interview?\" She said, \"That’s what I just said. Weren’t you listening? How many times do I have to say something?\" He said, \"Well, I was just double-checking. It’s like repeating a phone number or an address or something. I was just repeating your words.\" She hung up. He was glad she hadn’t asked his name.",
  "A young, single mom left her baby in a stroller on a train platform in midtown Manhattan. Police arrived. Children’s Services took custody of the baby. Police found the mom a day later. They charged her with child abandonment. Listening to the news, Becky asked, \"Does that mean she’ll go to jail?\" Ricky said, \"Well, it’s a felony, so she probably will. In New York, you can’t just leave a kid, any kid under 14, on a train platform or anywhere else. That’s abandonment. It’s okay if you leave an infant at a police station, hospital, or fire station. But that’s only if it’s 30 days old or less. Her baby was 10 months old.\" Becky said, \"So, what good is jail time?\" He said, \"Well, it’ll teach her not to do it again.\" Becky said, \"No, it’ll teach her to abandon her next baby before it’s 30 days old.\"",
  "Shirley said, \"Have you heard the news? The governor signed a marijuana law. Now all of us New Yorkers can smoke weed like everyone in all the other states. I’m going to Union Square and light one up. Finally, a victory for common sense.\" Mel said, \"Hold on. Are you already high? Where’d you get this information? None of it’s correct. First of all, it’s a medical marijuana law. It’s called the Compassionate Care Act. It’s only for people who are very sick. That means people with diseases like cancer, AIDS, or epilepsy. None of which you have! Further, ’all’ the other states haven’t legalized marijuana. Only 22 other states have done so, and that’s for medical marijuana. Finally, nobody’ll be allowed to actually smoke marijuana. They have to take a marijuana pill.\" She said, \"A pill? No way. Marijuana’s like tobacco — there’s the lighting, the smoking, the whole ritual.\"",
  "All of a sudden, there was no paper in the whole world. Every piece of paper vanished into thin air. Even the paper in people’s hands vanished from their hands. There were no receipts. There were no bills. There were no envelopes. There were no paper records in files and folders. There were no files and folders. There was no paper in printers. There were no napkins, tissues, or paper towels. There was no toilet paper! There were no bank checks. There were no maps or menus. There were no postage stamps. There were no newspapers, magazines, or books. There was clamor worldwide. Then a voice from the clouds said, \"You people are destroying all My trees. Thirty days from now, I will allow you to produce only one paper product worldwide. Make your choice. And quiet those car horns, or they’re next. We can’t get any sleep up here.\"",
  "The elderly man had long, dirty-looking hair and a scruffy beard. His clothes were rumpled and soiled. It was a warm, June afternoon. The annual Broadway Bites food festival was in full swing at 33rd Street and Broadway. About 30 vendors were selling delicious, but expensive, food at their booths. Hundreds of people were milling about the vendors. The man was carrying a big, plastic bag filled with empty cans. He showed no interest in the vendors or their customers. He was digging through a big, green, metal trashcan. His head went out of sight as he dug deeper. Instead of pulling out an empty can, he pulled out a half-eaten sandwich. He looked at it briefly before wolfing it down. Then he pulled a napkin out of the trashcan. He wiped his hands with it. Then he wiped his mouth with it. Then he walked to another trashcan nearby.",
  "Susie was reading her school essay to her granddad. She said, \"Researchers say that there are two kinds of ants in ant colonies. Scouts find the food. Gatherers take the food back to the nest. Gatherers are usually older ants.\" Her granddad said, \"Whoa. What do you mean ’older’? What does an older ant look like? Does it wear bifocals? Does it use a twig like a cane? Does it have bushy eyebrows?\" Susie laughed. She said, \"I don’t know, Grandpa. I just got this out of a magazine. You’re not supposed to ask questions like that.\" He said, \"Like what?\" She said, \"Like, questions that I can’t answer.\" He said, \"But if you write it, you have to be able to support it. Maybe your teacher or classmates will ask you the same question.\" She said, \"You’re right. I have the answer.",
  "They were watching a movie. \"Did you hear about Marlon Bogart?\" she asked. \"He complained about the trailer they’d given him on a movie set. The trailer was sky blue. He had asked for navy blue. He refused to work until they repainted it. How spoiled is that? Actors have such an easy life, and they still have the nerve to complain.\" He said, \"Everyone complains. Just because you’re rich, you can’t complain? Remember, actors like Marlon weren’t always rich and famous. Most started out with just a dime and a dream. They worked hard to get where they are. They went to hundreds of auditions. The big shots ignored them or gave them lots of grief, but they hung in there. Now they’re rich and famous. And if they want to act like babies, who cares? It’s not like parents point to actors as role models for their kids.\"",
  "He got on the northbound Q train. It was crowded and noisy. No seats were available. The annual Coney Island Mermaid Parade had just ended. Many happy parade-goers were heading home. A few stops later, one seat became available. A young lady sat down. Then she noticed him. Standing up, she said, \"You can have this seat, sir.\" He had two choices. He could stand, although he was tired, or he could sit. If he sat, his butt would be sitting on the hard plastic subway seat. Unlike many butts, his had little padding. His was mostly bone. Bone and hard plastic are not exactly made for each other. For him, sitting on a subway seat was like walking with a pebble in each shoe. A subway seat was not smooth colored plastic but a pile of jagged rocks. He smiled at the woman and said, \"No, but thank you.\"",
  "She said, \"Sometimes I can’t believe he’s actually my son. Sometimes I think they must have switched him at the hospital. I just can’t believe how lazy he is. I thought I’d raised him better. I’ve worked hard all my life. I rarely have ’fun,’ except when I watch TV or sit in Central Park. But most of the time I work or look for more work. But my son? Work is a four-letter word. He sits at home all day and plays computer games. Every night when I come home, I ask him, ’Did you find a job today?’ He always says, ’No, but maybe tomorrow.’ Tomorrow. That’s how I know he’s mine. He’s just like his father. That’s what I always used to ask his father. That’s what his father always used to say. That’s why I divorced his father. Now if I could only divorce his son.\"",
  "Joe and Marilyn were lying on the beach Sunday afternoon. She said, \"See you tomorrow night, honey.\" She walked to her car and drove to her sister’s place. Somewhat later, Joe ran over to the lifeguard stand. He said, \"My wife went swimming. I just woke up. I don’t see her anywhere.\" The lifeguard started a search. After a while, he called the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard searched for hours. The next morning, Joe called municipal court. Weeks earlier, Marilyn had bought some expensive jewelry. She’d used a credit card she had \"found.\" Joe said, \"Marilyn can’t appear in court today. She drowned yesterday.\" Marilyn came home Monday night. The police arrived minutes later. They had been waiting for her. They handcuffed Marilyn and Joe. He said, \"I told you this wouldn’t work.\" She said, \"It’s okay. At least you tried to help me. That’s what family is for.\"",
  "He bought some Old English Polish at Home Depot on West 23rd Street. Yesterday, a worker had dragged a coffee table across the hardwood floor in his living room. He hoped the polish would help conceal the scratches. As he crossed Broadway, he saw an attractive woman. She looked directly at him. She smiled and continued walking. He turned around and caught up to her. He said, \"Excuse me. Did you just smile at me, or was the sun in your eyes?\" She smiled again. She said, \"Yes, I smiled at you.\" He said, \"That was nice. I can’t remember the last time a pretty, young woman smiled at me. Would you like to have some coffee with me at Eataly?\" She said, \"No, but thank you. I’m sorry. That wasn’t a Let’s Have Coffee smile. It was more of a You Look Like You Could Use a Smile smile.\"",
  "Around the clock, officers sit in two NYPD cars at each end of the Brooklyn Bridge. Said one officer, \"Nobody is going to blow up this bridge. This is America’s bridge. We watch it like a hawk.\" About 3 o’clock one July morning, security cameras recorded five people walking on the footpath. Then all five disappeared from view. They climbed to the top of both 276-foot-tall towers. Using tin pans, they covered the lights that shone on both U.S. flags. They took down both big flags. They hung up two bleached white flags about the same size. They walked off the bridge before 4 a.m. Nobody noticed the white flags for several hours. On Channel 7 news that morning, a police spokesman said, \"We don’t know what the white flags mean.\"",
  "Some New York City Council members are upset. A new apartment building on the West Side has a \"poor door.\" One member said, \"About 200 units are for rich people. About 50 units are for poor people. But, only the rich get the river views. The poor get the street views — stop lights and street signs. Even worse, the poor have to use a separate building entrance and a separate elevator. That’s discrimination. That’s shameful!\" The developer responded, \"It’s totally legal. Other Manhattan buildings do the same thing. Besides, what’s to complain about? The lower-income tenants are getting a brand new building. It’s in a safe, beautiful neighborhood. Their units have central heat and air. Their rent is only 30 percent of the market rate. And the separate elevator is not discrimination. It’s freedom from discrimination. They won’t be riding up in an elevator with someone looking down on them.\"",
  "At 65, Dean’s father had died of a heart attack. Even though Dean was 60, he wasn’t worried about his heart. \"Lightning doesn’t strike twice,\" he told friends. They shook their heads. Every weekend he played golf with his best friend Jerry. One day, after walking uphill from the golf cart to the 17th green, Dean bent over, breathing hard. Jerry said, \"You know, you almost passed out here last week, too. Didn’t you see your doctor, like I told you?\" Dean said, \"It’s nothing. You worry too much.\" Late that night, Dean went downstairs to the kitchen. Fifteen minutes later, his wife went downstairs. The refrigerator door was open. He was lying on the floor.

He wasn’t doing any rescue breathing.\" A New York City Council member said, \"This is the sixth drowning this summer. This has got to stop. Our children are our future. I know all this will cost money, but lifeguards must stay on duty till sundown, not 6 p.m. Plus, we must hire 200 more lifeguards every summer.

That Niro guy was in it. And that little, short guy — Joe something. It was directed by that goofy-looking guy. He used to be a video store clerk. Now he’s a famous director.

  "It was 10:30 p.m. and drizzling. Mom pulled into the empty parking lot at a small market in Queens. Her two-year-old daughter was strapped into the baby seat. Without turning off the engine, Mom ran into the store. She bought some milk for her daughter and dashed back outside. Her car was gone. She screamed, \"Where’s my baby? Where’s my baby?\" She called the police. About 30 minutes later, they found her car. The keys and her unharmed baby were still in the car. Thanking the good Lord, she drove home.

They say a million locals and tourists are going to watch it live.\" He said, \"No, thank you. That parade glorifies genocide. The early Europeans murdered millions of First Americans. What’s to celebrate about that?\" She said, \"Well, when you put it that way, not much. But remember, European diseases killed many First Americans. The Europeans didn’t just slaughter First Americans like they were buffalo. Besides, what would you really prefer? Today we can thank our European heritage for many things, such as indoor plumbing. Or, would you prefer that nobody had ever arrived here after the First Americans? In that case, America would probably still be in the Stone Age.",

  "In 1962, Paul invented a board game. He named it Careful Doctors. His game involved a plastic human patient, tweezers, an imaginary operating room, and a buzzer. The objective was to remove a body part from the patient without touching hidden alarms. Touching an alarm caused the buzzer to sound, penalizing the player. Paul’s family tried out his game, but wasn’t impressed. So, Paul sold his game to Hasgro, a popular game developer, for $500. With the money, Paul bought a used, \"in excellent condition\" Edsel. Hasgro tweaked the game a little and renamed it. By 1972, Hasgro had sold eight million upgrades of Paul’s original game. Paul’s brother told him about the fortune Hasgro was making from his game. He said, \"They should give you some of that.\" Paul said, \"No. They tweaked it. They marketed it. They don’t owe me anything.",

She said, \"You have cellulitis; it’s a bacterial infection.\" She wrote a prescription for an antibiotic.

Go to a job interview. Call your mom! When you finish one thing, you feel good. You did it. It’s history. A done deal. But you can’t just sit there patting yourself on the back. You have to do the next thing. And when you finish the next thing, then the next thing. It never ends. As long as you live, you will have something to do. That is the nature of life, the burden of life, the opportunity of life.",
  "The gangsters were filthy rich from selling drugs. They could buy anything they wanted. They bought fast cars with their drug money. They bought acres of land with their drug money. They bought a huge house with their drug money. They bought expensive art for their house. They bought expensive furniture for their house. But something was missing. They wanted a big painting in their foyer — a big painting of their happy \"family.\" They called many artists, but they all said they were \"busy.\" But one day an artist called the gangsters. He said he would paint the foyer. They agreed to his very high price. Upset, his wife said, \"Don’t work for them. They’re gangsters. Their money’s tainted.\" He said, \"No, their money’s green. And their green money will take us to that one place that you’ve been dreaming of your whole life — Hawaii.",
  "He had an ear problem. His doctor gave him nose medicine. She said, \"It’s nose medicine, but it should work because your nose and your ears are connected.\" The medicine was expensive. It was $108. One little bottle was $108. How could a little bottle of nose spray be so expensive, he wondered. She said to spray the medicine into his nose twice a day. Two sprays in the morning, and two in the evening. No problem, he thought. She told him to use the nose spray for three weeks. Then she would examine him again. If the nose spray didn’t work, she’d prescribe a different medicine. If that medicine didn’t work, she’d probably have to perform surgery. He said that ear surgery sounded terrible. He didn’t want her digging into his ear. She said, \"Oh, I’m not going to ’dig’ into your ear. I’ll be going through your nose.\"",
  "It was the seventh game of the World Series. The NY Mets were playing the NY Yankees. It was the Subway Series. Yankee Stadium was packed. The winner of this game would be the world champion. Everyone expected a pitcher’s duel. The two starting pitchers were the best in baseball. Tim Seaver was the Mets pitcher. Dwayne Gooden was the Yankees pitcher. The game began. Each pitcher befuddled batters. Batters struck out swinging. Batters struck out looking. Batters hit weak grounders. Batters hit pop flies. Batters went to the plate determined. Batters returned to the dugout dejected. It was a scoreless game until the bottom of the ninth inning. With two out and two strikes, Rickey Mantle hit a home run. The Yankees won 1-0. For the first time in history, they gave the Most Valuable Player award to three players — Seaver, Gooden, and Mantle. Fans applauded the decision.",
  "The world’s biggest ship traveled south down the Hudson River. Its name is Moby-Ship. Everyone on both shores stared. A man said, \"It’s bigger than the Empire State Building.\" Moby-Ship turned left before it neared the Statue of Liberty. It headed toward the Brooklyn Bridge. Moby-Ship runs on cheap, air-polluting coal. Its huge smokestack is 300 feet tall. The Brooklyn Bridge walkway is 280 feet above water. Many locals and tourists were walking on the bridge. They saw Moby-Ship approaching. They saw the smokestack. They pointed and hollered. They started running. They rushed helter-skelter off the bridge. The captain was watching them. He laughed uncontrollably. Then he pushed a button. The smokestack telescoped down 50 feet. Moby-Ship went under the Brooklyn Bridge. A police boat pulled Moby-Ship over. The captain said, \"What’s the problem? People enjoy a good scare. They got one. I enjoy a good laugh. I got one.\"",

She was like a vulture, Lily thought. If Ms. Bates spotted a calculator, she swooped down, grabbed the calculator in her claws, and flew off. At home, Lily used her calculator with abandon. She used it to add. She used it to subtract. She used it to multiply. She used it to divide. The harder the math problem, the more she loved her calculator.

  "In Paris, two gunmen told a woman to type in the code to enter an office building. Fearing for her life, she did as ordered. The gunmen entered the building with her. They all went up to the second floor. The second floor was where the cartoonists — the target — produced a weekly satirical magazine. The cartoonists delighted in belittling others. They ridiculed everyone and everything — celebrities, politicians, governments, corporations, and religions. The gunmen calmly shot most workers in the office, killing 12 before departing. The finger of blame points at the gunmen. They were simply too sensitive about their religion and its prophet. The cartoons were only satire. The finger points at the cartoonists. Believing that freedom of speech is unlimited, they relentlessly mocked the religion and prophet of the gunmen. The finger points at the woman, who was uninjured. She sacrificed a dozen coworkers when she opened that door.",

A reporter stopped the parents on their way out of court. She asked, \"Are you upset that he didn’t apologize?\" Jenny’s mom said, \"No. He’s right. Killers can’t win.

Since then, only four black men have won Best Actor. Only one black woman has won Best Actress. Only one black picture has won Best Picture. No black director has ever won Best Director.

  "Could it be true? A professional football team had cheated in a playoff game? It had underinflated eleven of its twelve game balls so the quarterback could throw, and receivers could catch, the footballs more easily throughout the game’s wet, windy, and cold weather? Shocking! Then again, stranger things have happened. Paid to seek The Truth for football fans, reporters pestered the coach. He said maybe his team’s footballs had less pressure because they’d sat outside in the cold weather. (The opposing team’s twelve footballs, which were not underinflated, had also sat outside in the same cold weather.) His response didn’t reassure fans. Reporters pestered the quarterback. A reporter asked, \"Are you a cheater?\" The quarterback, football’s golden boy, said, \"I don’t believe so.\" His response didn’t reassure fans. Exasperated, the team owner told reporters, \"Of course we didn’t cheat. If we had cheated, all twelve balls would’ve been underinflated.\"",

What precision plowing, he thought. But, more important, he thought, Four trucks — just to push snow to the curb? He invented a snow-melter, similar to a blow dryer. His invention simply redirected, at the flick of a switch, the heat escaping from the exhaust pipe to an \"exhaust bumper\" on the front of the truck. The driver can adjust the bumper to various heights and aim the \"blow holes\" in the bumper in various directions. Now, instead of pushing the snow, modified trucks simply melt it.",

By using Sender with a GoPro camera, a doer could record everything that he sensed and thought during, for example, a skydive. Then, after a watcher downloaded Mark’s Receiver (for a small fee) and connected to the doer’s Sender (for a small fee), he could enjoy the skydive exactly as the doer had enjoyed it. That is, the watcher could sense everything that the doer sensed, from jumping into empty air, feeling the wind in his face, and feeling the chute catch air, to hitting the ground. The watcher could experience the doer’s every thought and feeling — without ever stepping out the door.",
  "Bob called NYC’s public radio station, WXTRAPC. He told the ombudsman, \"You used to be an American English station. Nowadays I’m hearing about 70-percent English, 20-percent Spanish, and 10-percent Other. So, 30 percent of the time, I might as well be listening to static. You interview someone somewhere, and you pronounce their name and their country fluently in their native language. For example, your reporter introduces Frrahn-seesko from Cheelay. That’s static to me. How about, Francisco from Chile? Then, to make communication — you’re supposed to be communicating, you know — worse, your reporter translates what the interviewee is saying while the interviewee is talking. Two voices, and two languages, at once! Hello — Communication 101, one speaker at a time.\" The ombudsman said, \"Sir, perhaps you’d appreciate both voices more if you learned a second language.\" Bob said, \"Never! I’m a flag-waving veteran. A second language will never taint my all-American tongue.\"",
  "Sue said, \"My coworker ratted on me. She told my supervisor I left work fifteen minutes early yesterday. Fifteen minutes, and she had to go tattle to the boss. I need to find another job.\" Bill said, \"Well, good luck finding one where your coworkers won’t stab you in the back. When I was a young man, I thought America was one big, happy family. All for one, and one for all. Ha! No way! This country is not only every man for himself, but every group for itself: blacks versus whites, Muslims versus Christians, and poor versus rich, to name a few.\" She said, \"Well, you omitted the biggest ’versus’ of all, and it’s worldwide, not just in America.\"",
  "\"Mary\" saw a halo of light. It said, \"Hello.\" She said, \"Hello. Am I in heaven?\" It said, \"I’m afraid not.\" She gasped. \"Am I in hell?\" The halo said, \"There is no hell, and there is no heaven. There is no ’Earth.’ There are no people, or plants, or animals. There isn’t even me. There’s only you. And you are only energy. You, and you alone, constitute the universe. Your energy fuels your imagination. Your imagination constantly creates new ’lives’ on ’Earth’ for you. Each life seems real. You are born, you live, and you die. Each life seems like many years, but lasts only a fraction thereof. You have already lived millions of lives. They all seemed real, but none of them were. The only thing real is you, as energy. You have no shape. You have no substance. You have existed forever, and you will exist forever.\"",
  "My dad, 87, was in a hospital room in Alabama awaiting gall bladder surgery. I called him Tuesday morning. We talked for five minutes. Several times he said, \"I’m out of breath.\" Then he started coughing. Then he threw up. He said he had to go. It was 10:10. I should’ve called Mom. She would have immediately driven over to the hospital and sat with Dad. She would have screamed at the nurses and doctors to \"Do something!\" I didn’t even call the nurses’ station to say he’d just thrown up. My dad had to suffer all alone, \"out of breath\" for three more hours, until he coded at 1:00. They revived him. Then they took him to CCU, and he coded again. He died at 4:20 p.m. Had I called Mom at 10:10, Dad might still be alive. Instead, I’m still alive, with this regret to relive every day.",
  "His wife asked, \"Why are you whistling?\" He said, \"Because I’ve become an optimist. I’m no longer the pessimist with the long face that you complain about. Instead of worrying that something bad is going to happen to me, I expect something bad to happen to me. For example, my doctor just cut skin cancer out of my face. So I feel good, right? But I don’t feel good just because the cancer is gone. Because I know something is going to take its place, something far worse. But so far, whatever’s next, like terminal brain cancer, hasn’t struck me yet. When it does, it won’t be an unpleasant surprise. I’m ready for it. But as long as it doesn’t hit me, it’s a pleasant surprise. I’m still healthy. So, that’s why I feel good. That’s why I’m whistling.\"",
  "New York City has a liberal city council. It thinks that the poor are too poor and the rich are too rich. It doesn’t think anything about the middle class, because in NYC there isn’t any middle class. The council had a plan. It would tax the rich and distribute the money to help the poor. The mayor told the council speaker, \"That’s a great idea. The rich should help their fellow New Yorkers.\" So, the council passed a new tax law. It worked very well for ten years. Then it stopped working. The liberal rich were all broke; the conservative rich had all moved to Connecticut. The only people still living in NYC were the poor. The mayor and the city council members had to take a 99-percent pay cut. The mayor told the council speaker, \"Your tax law was a stupid idea.\"",
  "Bob took the B train to get to a 10 o’clock interview at 245 West Houston. Unemployed, Bob hoped to shine at his Veterans Affairs interview. The three interviewers introduced themselves. The interviewer wearing the pink shirt reminded Bob of someone he disliked. Early on, Bob realized that the interview wasn’t going well. The interviewers asked difficult questions about the VA. Bob was clueless. Equally vexing was that \"Mr. Pink\" began each of his questions to Bob by saying Bob’s name slowly, as one might address a child — or a moron. After Mr. Pink began with \"B-o-b\" the third time, Bob interrupted, saying, \"Excuse me, why do you keep repeating my name?\" Mr. Pink said, \"Well, ’Bob’ is your name, isn’t it?\" Bob said, \"I asked you why. You know, ’why.’\" Slowly, Bob spelled, \"W-h-y.\" Mr. Pink said, \"That’s funny — you, condescending to me. This interview is over. That’s o-v-e-r.\"",
  "Joe swore that his ex-wife still loved him. Mel laughed. \"She divorced you. She said that she no longer loves you. She said she was tired of you always breaking your promises and always apologizing for breaking them. She said in the beginning you were her king, her everything. Now, that’s all changed. She moved uptown, and she never gave you her new address. She doesn’t text or talk to you. So, how in the world can you possibly think that she still loves you?\" Joe said, \"It’s real simple. If she didn’t love me, she wouldn’t mind seeing me and talking to me every day; I’d be just another guy. But by refusing to talk to me or see me, it proves how much she still loves me, because it hurts her so much being with me but not being able to be with me permanently.",
  "He slowly peeled the two Band-Aids off his face. They covered some ointment on his cheek and nose. The ointment covered about 25 stitches. The stitches were a result of recent Mohs surgery for skin cancer. Using his fingers and soap and water, he removed the ointment. He rinsed his face. Then he opened the tube of ointment. He squeezed a glob of ointment onto a Q-tip and applied the ointment to all the stitches. \"Keep them moist,\" his doctor had said. Once he’d moistened the whole area, he put a couple of new Band-Aids on his face. He did this twice a day for five days. On the fifth day, he went to the doctor’s office. She wiped the ointment off his face and removed all the stitches. \"You look good,\" she said. He smiled. She was being nice. But, more important, he felt good. He was cancer free.",
  "The mayor ignored the daily complaints about \"psycho-lists\" running amok on New York City streets. It didn’t bother her that adult cyclists sped on sidewalks, or that cyclists rode the wrong way on one-way streets, or that cyclists ignored stop signs and traffic lights, or that cyclists didn’t use headlights and taillights after dark. None of these things bothered Her Honor — until a cyclist ran into her son, Dante, while he was walking and texting on the sidewalk. He spent several weeks in Lenox Hill Hospital. Police didn’t find the culprit. But errant cyclists were soon to regret Dante’s mishap. A new regulation appeared in NYC media and in subway cars and stations a month after Dante left the hospital. It warned cyclists that violating certain bicycle laws would result in the immediate seizure and prompt auction of the violator’s bicycle. To Citi Bike’s dismay, the regulation included rental bikes.",

It’s still part of the First Amendment.\" He said, \"Well, you better check your Bill of Rights. They rewrote the First Amendment. It now says, ’you have freedom of speech only if your speech is politically correct,’ or ’PC,’ as everyone says. And the PC police are everywhere. Nowadays you have to talk nice about everyone and everything. For example, I used to crack a lot of fat jokes. Now I can’t even say ’fat.’ You can’t say anything even slightly negative about someone’s race, color, religion, creed, gender, ethnicity, or age. You can’t talk about politics, abortion, immigration, living wages, or gun control without getting into an argument.",
  "The city council thinks New York City has too many laws. It wants to decriminalize certain activities. Decriminalization will result in fewer people going to jail. People will simply pay a fine, as they do for a parking ticket, instead of dealing with a criminal charge. For example, if someone pees on a sidewalk, or on a subway platform, or in a subway car, he’ll pay a fine, say $1. If he poos in public, maybe $2. If he drinks alcohol in public, or litters, or jumps subway turnstiles, he’ll pay a fine. The police commissioner said, \"This is a slippery slope. If you decriminalize A and B, why not C and D? E and F? Why not decriminalize robbery? Taken to the extreme, why not decriminalize murder? Murder someone, pay a $10,000 fine. Sounds crazy now, but given enough time, it’ll get a green light, just like same-sex marriage.\"",

An old green van was double-parked in the northbound lane closest to the church. At 8 p.m. the yard sale was long over, but the broken-down van was still there, forcing vehicles to go around it. At 11 p.m. the van owner placed a large cardboard box, with a tray of ripe tomatoes clearly visible on top, 20 feet behind his van. At 1 a.m. a lone pedestrian walked off with the tray. Sunday morning, the van owner exited his unticketed van and walked back to the box. He picked it up and put it into his van. Late that night, he placed the box back in the street.

He couldn’t wash his dishes without hearing her saying, \"Rinse them thoroughly!\" He couldn’t brush his teeth without seeing her standing at the bathroom sink, her toothbrush in her right hand and a cup of water in her left hand, brushing and gargling and spitting, over and over. He couldn’t take his socks off without thinking of her tiny feet, and how she loved his massaging them before going to sleep. Day and night, he couldn’t listen to any love song without thinking of her. Had almost every love song in the world been written just about her? Then Percy Sledge died. That day many radio and TV stations played Percy’s peerless \"When a Man Loves a Woman.\" That love song is different, Bruce thought. It was written about him.",

But expecting an important email, Jesse clicked on Google and then g-mail. The teacher walked by his desk. She said, \"Why are you on the Internet?\" Jesse said, \"I’m sorry,\" and immediately logged off. That evening he couldn’t sleep. All he did was worry. Are they going to fire me tomorrow, he wondered. If asked why he was online, his only defense was that he forgot. But that’s no good, he thought. Nobody wants an employee who can’t remember simple rules. Saying \"I forgot\" is no better than saying \"I felt like it.\"",

Charley found himself sitting on the platform; he couldn’t get up. Immediately, two strangers on the platform grabbed him from front and behind and pulled him up to his feet. Dazed, Charley thanked them and stepped onto the train. The doors tried to close on him, but he squeezed through and grabbed a seat. He shook his head.

How frustrated the owner must feel to see customers enjoying themselves on both sides of his restaurant, but not one customer in his own restaurant. As Godfrey continued walking east, a teenage boy skateboarded up to him and stopped. He said, \"Mister, is today a holiday for living soldiers or dead ones? Tell my sister, please.\" He handed Godfrey his mobile phone. Godfrey said, \"Hello. Memorial Day is for all our soldiers killed in all our wars. If those million brave soldiers hadn’t died, you’d both be in school today.\" She said, \"Really? Well, I’m sure glad they did.

  "Seeking approval from FAA, Smelta Airlines proposed several changes. It wants to reduce the size of carry-on luggage \"approximately 20 percent.\" According to measurements submitted to FAA, the new luggage size would actually be the size of a man’s size 12E shoebox. Smelta said the new size would minify light travelers’ decision-making about \"What to pack?\" Its other changes involved price and seat location. It wants to charge lighter people less, and heavier people more. For example, it would charge a 100-pound person $100 one-way. It would charge a 150-pound person $150, and so on. Further, it would seat people according to their weight. The lightest people would sit up front; the heaviest would sit in the back. Smelta said this proposal would help passengers become more weight-conscious and help its planes achieve faster take-offs. Cynics predict FAA will allow \"a whole day\" for public comments before rubber-stamping Smelta’s proposals.",

Or, we could make the horn ’renewable.’ You only get 50 honks. When you run out of honks, you have to buy more honks.\" The mayor loved both ideas, but the governor didn’t. The mayor’s wife made a suggestion. She said, \"Let’s have a monthly ’Win, Place, Show’ contest. We’ll give ribbons to the dumbest honkers we can find. Maybe we can embarrass people into stopping honking.\" Five weeks later, at city hall, the mayor feted the top three honkers. \"Show\" won for honking at an old lady using a walker in a crosswalk. \"Place\" won for honking in a $350 \"Don’t Honk\" zone. \"Win\" won for honking at 10 cars in front of him waiting on a red light.",
  "Sue was training for a job with a NYC agency. She was with other trainees in a domestic violence class in Harlem. During class and as an aside, the trainer told a personal story regarding a recent news incident. James followed up with, \"Well, look at the judges in that state. They’re all white.\" The trainer went back to domestic violence. Sue interrupted. \"Excuse me, but what James just said sounded racist.\" James said he’d simply made an observation. Sue said, \"Oh. Okay. Well, has anyone noticed that all the trainers in all our classes have been black?\" James said, \"What’s that supposed to mean? Do you have a problem with black trainers?\" Sue said, \"I was just making an observation.\" James said, \"That’s it? Just an ’observation’? That’s hard to believe.\" Sue said, \"Exactly. Who makes pointless observations? Nobody says something like, say, ’They’re all white,’ without a reason.\"",
  "The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision Friday, approved same-sex marriage nationwide. President Obama called the decision a \"victory for America.\" The White House, using colorful lighting, became the Rainbow House that evening. Nyers danced outside the Stonewall Inn while same-sex partners kissed and hugged one another. The LGBTQ community lauded the decision. Said one NYer, \"Does it get any better than this? We can now get married in all 50 states. And our marriages are lawful. Our love for our partner is recognized as a legal union. Love has won; bigotry has lost.\" An evangelist said, \"What does Obama mean, it’s a ’victory for America’? I’m an American. It’s no victory for me or other American Christians. It’s no victory for the Bible, America’s only path to salvation. Just as those sinners fought for this decision, we’re going to fight to reverse it. And God is on our side.\"",

  "It’s the future. The United States, population one billion, is as crowded as a rush hour 6 train. Crowded people are irritable people. Irritable people argue, fight, and kill. The President declared, \"We can’t go on like this. The first thing that too many people do when someone irritates them is to call that person a name, usually related to his race. We’re supposed to be a melting pot, but we’re still a tossed salad. So, my new executive order divides the U.S.A. into ten geographical areas. One area will be exclusively white people, another area solely black people, and so on. The tenth area will be only mixed races.

She spritzed the potion from her fourth-floor walkup in the Bronx. A month later, everyone on Earth who had self-destructive habits changed for the better. Smokers stopped smoking. Drinkers stopped drinking. Overeaters stopped overeating. Gamblers stopped gambling. Cheaters stopped cheating. Liars stopped lying. Nobody could figure out the cause of these changes until Maria stepped forward. Millions praised her. But millions of others didn’t. Smokers missed smoking. Drinkers missed drinking. Others missed their bad habits, too. Soon, they demanded that Maria \"undo\" her potion. Crossing her fingers, she said, \"If only there were an antidote.\"",

He asked, \"Senior citizens?\" She said no. He asked, \"AARP?\" She said no. Wally paid the nine dollars. He sat alone in a middle car. The coaster creaked slowly up a steep slope. Then, rapidly, it descended almost vertically. Wally’s glasses started vibrating violently. He felt like all his bones were rattling against one another. The coaster made five more steep descents and five sharp left to right turns. When it stopped, Wally, feeling nauseous, laboriously climbed out of his seat.

Young newcomer Matt Stonie had edged out the favored champ, Joey, by two hotdogs. Frank asked, \"Why do you think Joey lost?\" Ralphie said, \"Well, first of all, it was an overcast day. Joey, I would say, is a hot weather eater. So, the cooler temperature might’ve slowed him down. Also, as everyone knows, Joey recently broke up with his fiancée, so that must have been weighing on his mind.\" Frank agreed. Listener Bert called in. He said, \"Come on, you two.

Hotdog as in Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July International Hotdog Eating Contest, in its 43rd year. The men’s contest was a battle of the buns, a duel of the dogs, as eight-time, reigning champ Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut matched mouthfuls with chomping challenger Matt Stonie. After 10 minutes of wolfing wieners and swilling water, Stonie won the war of the wurst by a paltry two pups, 62 to 60. The victory didn’t exactly surprise Stonie, who had beaten Joey six times, head to head, in the past year in other eating contests. In accepting his victory belt, Stonie shouted \"Frank you!\" to 2,000 cheering spectators. The announcer announced it was an \"incredible battle between two incredible athletes.\" Wiener warriors have come a long way since 1980, when nine dogs won.",

Lee could easily have moved his left arm slightly to the right, but Lee had been sitting there first. But the guy, apparently oblivious or maybe even gay, didn’t move his arm away.

To join the lottery, a person merely submitted the names of people he knew who regularly, or even occasionally, drove after drinking.

Startled, Sheldon yelled an angry word at the man, who turned his head and yelled the same word back. Throughout NYC, cyclists had narrowly missed Sheldon so often that he was sure he was going to die as a bicycle victim on a city sidewalk. His fear of such a death had created an ill will toward adult bicyclists. When he read news stories about bicyclists killed by drivers, he felt no sympathy.

One time he asked a 250-pound woman who had just squeezed in, \"Look! The whole car is totally empty. Why’d you have to sit right next to me?\" She said, \"I don’t know. It’s like some force pulled me over here.\"",
  "Glen and Tanya were holdovers. A NYC agency had decided to train them and four other students for two additional weeks. It hoped that they could all pass the final that they had failed the first time around. It wanted them to exchange their dunce hats for graduation caps. The additional class time helped immensely. Everyone except Tanya \"saw the light.\" But Glen coached her every day, patiently explaining each procedure that she was still having difficulty with. Finally, she too saw the light. Everyone passed the final. On Friday, graduation day, Tanya gave Glen a gift. He asked, \"What’s this?\" She said, \"Just a little thank-you.\" The following Monday, he returned it to her, unopened. She said, \"What’s this?\" He said, \"I ’accepted’ this, but only because I didn’t want to rain on your weekend. I’m sorry, but I can’t accept a gift just for doing the right thing.\"",
  "A woman in a suit rang the bell. Brian opened his door. The woman asked, \"Sir, are you Brian Simon?\" He nodded. She said, \"Correct me if I’m wrong. You own this Brooklyn brownstone. You signed an online petition demanding that all fences be torn down on U.S. borders. The petition declared that fences are unneighborly and useless.\" Brian nodded again. She said, \"Sir, tomorrow morning a city crew will remove this iron fence that fronts your brownstone.\" Brian snorted, saying, \"They can’t do that! This is my property!\" She continued, \"Sir, you’re an American citizen. The entire United States is your property. If you favor no fences for your big home, it stands to reason that you think likewise for your little home.\" Brian stammered, \"But, but, they’re different!\" She said, \"You can’t have it both ways, sir. Here’s a $50 check for the value of the scrap metal.\"",
  "Chad was running late, but he didn’t know exactly how late. Seeing beautiful Monique on the sidewalk, he figured he’d kill two birds with one stone. Summoning his inner Cary Grant, he asked if she had the time. Monique answered, \"You know, that’s funny. You’re asking me the time, but I was just wondering the same thing myself! Isn’t that a coincidence! Did you leave your watch at home too? I was in such a hurry this morning. I overslept, something I rarely do. But last night my kids kept me up till eleven playing Scrabble. My kids are so smart. They beat my pants off! They must have gotten their smarts from their dad. Although if he was that smart, he wouldn’t have had that affair. I should’ve divorced that man on the spot. Wait! Didn’t you ask me something? Or did I ask you?\" Chad had raced off.",
  "Reverend Hal Sharple, a popular NYC blactivist, often appears at the scene of a murder when the victim is black and the killer is white. Speaking before TV and radio station microphones and cameras, he lambastes racist whites who, as policemen or civilians, don’t seem to know or care that Black Lives Matter. But when blacks murder whites, Sharple not only fails to appear at the scene, but also fails to voice any disapproval. He says nothing about racist blacks. He says nothing about White Lives Matter. When asked about his two disparate responses to racial murders, Sharple said, \"For one thing, they’re different. And if you don’t know in your own heart how they’re different, I could never explain it to you. For another, I can’t speak up for every victim of every color. Where are the white preachers? I’m too busy speaking up for all the black victims.\"",
  "Overhearing Leonard’s short joke about two white peanut farmers, an elderly man called him a racist. Leonard said, \"Really? It’s such a pleasure meeting someone who doesn’t make snap judgments. You don’t even know my name, but you know I’m a low-life racist. From one joke. What if I told a fat joke? I hate all fat people? What if I told a dumb blonde joke? I’m a misogynist? I hate my mom, my wife, and my beautiful daughter? What if I told a joke about a chicken crossing the road? I’m an animal hater? How about a joke about a priest, rabbi, and minister walking into a bar? I’m an atheist? How about a joke about the government? I’m an anarchist? Of course not. So one little joke about people of noncolor doesn’t make me a racist. ’Racist’ jokes don’t make us racists. They help us deal with racists.\"",
  "Jim’s mom was notorious for her long-winded stories about her daily routine. These stories, full of mundane details, never had a payoff, punch line, or point. After months of calling her daily after his dad’s death, Jim was getting tired of hearing these monologues. One day he said, \"Now, don’t take this personally, but...\" She said, \"Never mind. I don’t want to hear it. Every time somebody says that, I end up crying.\" He said, \"Okay, I understand. How about if I suggest something, but do it indirectly?\" She said, \"Well, okay, maybe.\" He said, \"You love reading your mystery novels. You’ve probably read 10,000 in your life.\"",
  "After looking both ways, even though Bergen Street is one-way, he crossed. He stood near the subway station railing and looked toward the 78th Precinct building. A pretty woman in a sundress walked by. Like many young women in Brooklyn, she had a tattoo. Hers was on her upper back, just south of her slender neck. It was circular, about the diameter of a silver dollar. It was kind of \"lacey\"; lots of circular links comprised one large circle. The ink was one color — light green. He was sure that the tattoo meant something. He was sure that she liked men asking, \"What is this?\" It meant nothing to him. He couldn’t help but notice one other thing about her tattoo. It was off-center. It was about a quarter-inch too far right. He said, \"Oh, Miss!\" She stopped and turned around. Thinking better of it, he simply said, \"Nice tattoo.\"",
  "National Liberal Radio, or NLR, is a public radio network that loves to produce stories about America’s poor, all of whom seem to be people of color being held down by America’s whites, all of whom seem to have wallets full of plastic and personalities full of themselves. NLR dismisses as hopelessly biased such news organizations as conservative WOLF News, which calls itself \"fair and balanced.\" Snorted an NLR executive, \"WOLF’s idea of giving both sides of a story is when they follow a quote from a Republican senator with a quote from a Republican congressman.\" Meanwhile, NLR’s own \"fair and balanced\" reporting never includes the phrase \"illegal immigration.\" NLR opts for the simpler \"immigration,\" as in, \"Most whites are against immigration.\"",
  "Talking to a customer, she said, \"No, I didn’t say the number four the first time. I said the number seven. The two numbers don’t even sound alike. How could you have heard four when I said seven? I mean, I could understand if you think I said eleven, because eleven sounds a lot like seven. But I never say eleven. I heard that some kid couldn’t dial the police once in an emergency because his mom had told him to dial nine-eleven instead of 9-1-1. The poor kid couldn’t find eleven on the dial pad. So I never say eleven, so you couldn’t have mistaken eleven for seven. Hold on a second. I’ll just double-check. Oops! I think you’re right. It is a seven.

  "It was 9 a.m. Herb was in an all-day class on Lenox Avenue near the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The topic was customer service. The instructor introduced herself and threw in a few personal facts, such as she had two teen sons who were a handful. She handed out the day’s agenda to the adult students, and asked them to introduce themselves. She added, \"Share a fun fact about yourself if you have one, please.\" His classmates’ fun facts, such as \"I like to knit,\" were putting Herb to sleep. When it was his turn, he said, \"My fun fact is that I have ten toes.\" A classmate said, \"What’s ’fun fact’ about that? Everyone has ten toes.\" Herb said, \"Six on one foot and four on the other?\" Everyone groaned in revulsion. Herb placed a loafered foot on a chair. \"Anyone want to see?\" he asked. Everyone groaned again.",
  "It was 2 a.m. He awoke, howling. A cramp had curled all his toes and his entire right foot into a knot as hard as any knot in any hardwood tree. He downed the small glass of salt water sitting on the nightstand. Nothing happened. He didn’t bother trying to stand on the ballerina-like foot. He didn’t bother trying to massage it. After a minute, his toes and foot relaxed. Salt water no longer worked; magnesium pills no longer worked. Later, he called his sister.

What is a huge lottery prize but income inequality?  There’s but a breath of a chance that one person will win $100 million or more. But whoever does win becomes an instant one-percenter. He’s not on our team anymore. He becomes one of ’them,’ while the rest of us settle for the crumbs. We invest our hard-earned dollars simply to create another one-percenter. Our money becomes our honchos’ money.\" She said, \"But you have a solution.\" He said, \"Of course. It’s so simple. Spread the wealth. Instead of one prize worth $100 million, let’s have 200 prizes worth $500,000. Half a million won’t make anyone a one-percenter, but at least it’ll help 200 of us live a little less on the edge.\"",

  "Northnorth, a new U.S. airline, bragged, \"If we’re late, we pay.\" Passengers flocked to buy tickets, unaware of Northnorth’s bogus definitions of \"late\" and \"pay\" buried in its 400-page Terms of Use. However, passengers quickly became aware of the airline’s other penny-pinching tactics. It flies unwashed, older planes. A passenger reserving a window seat, which costs extra, can pay more extra to have his window pre-washed if he wants to view takeoffs and landings. A peanut dispenser delivers 10 raw, unsalted peanuts for a dollar, paid for, like all other amenities, with a credit card swipe. Free, uniodized salt is usually available in the shaker chained to the dispenser. Reclining seatbacks cost a quarter a minute, as do the overhead, fresh-air blowers. Any passenger willing to stand in the aisle can fly half-price. He doesn’t have to worry about blocking the flight attendants because, like the toilets, there are none.",

  "Penny turned the page of the magazine. A two-color photo filled the next two pages. She was about to turn the page again when she happened to catch the caption. It said that the artist had decided that pink smoke billowing out of a yellow spaghetti squash was \"art.\" Studying the photo, Penny decided that it was pretty cool. She wondered how the artist was able to make pink smoke come out of a yellow squash. In the caption, however, he didn’t explain how he did it. He just said, \"The purpose of art is to turn the mundane into the strange.\" At a street fair a week later, Penny watched a man dressed in a clown costume twist and tie ordinary multi-colored pipe cleaners into animal figures. Picking up a \"dog,\" Penny asked, \"Is this art?\" The man said, \"Miss, for $1.50, you can call it whatever you like.\"",
  "Hiram went to a job interview on Houston Street. Three men were sitting at a large wooden table. He knew these men. They had interviewed him once already for a counseling job in the Manhattan office. Today’s interview was for the Brooklyn office. Halfway through the interview, a cellphone vibrated. An interviewer went outside to answer the call. Meanwhile, Hiram noticed another interviewer scrolling through his cellphone. The third interviewer asked Hiram, \"What’s your greatest strength?\" The other interviewer reentered the room. This time his phone rang, and he answered it quietly at the table. Hiram said, \"Empathy. I’m very good at tuning into how others are feeling. For example, I see that two of you are busy with your phones. That’s because I’m boring you. I apologize. In fact, I’m boring myself.\" With that, Hiram took out his own cellphone, turned it on, and silently started checking his email.",

  "A Russian passenger plane headed out of Egypt to St. Petersburg. The plane disintegrated shortly after reaching 31,000 feet. A terrorist group had achieved its long-sought goal. The group leader proclaimed responsibility for all 224 deaths. Airline and government officials quickly dismissed the claim. A week went by. President Obama said that maybe terrorists had indeed planted a bomb on the plane. The terrorist leader told his second in command, \"’Maybe’?! They continue to underestimate us. Next year, we will rock their world. Next year we’ll make 9/11 look like the pop of an American boy’s cap pistol.\" In addition to the cargo bomb, the group had developed an idiot-proof, hide-in-plain-sight, carry-on bomb. The day before Thanksgiving, 100 loyalists boarded 100 passenger planes worldwide. The planes lifted into the air within minutes of one another. Half an hour later, the zealots blew themselves and the planes out of the sky.",

After he helped her put on a dark gray vest she was interested in, he stood next to her while she looked in the mirror. He looked at himself. He saw his big ears and his small head. He didn’t have just a pinhead; he also had an egghead. He was a pinhead-egghead! He saw his narrow shoulders and wide hips. He had a shape like a diamond, more womanly than manly.

  "A pound of ground beef costs $8. A pound of ground coffee costs $15. A pound of ground horn — rhino horn — costs $30,000. However, rhino horn customers aren’t complaining. They know that $30,000 is cheap compared to what they’ll have to pay for the last horn from the last rhino standing. They’re prepared to pay a million dollars for it. They’re even prepared to kill one another to get their hands on that horn; murder of a few fellow connoisseurs is incidental to those who would murder an entire species. Incidentally, an archaeology team recently dug up a scroll from an emperor’s gravesite in Asia.

He illegally drove an A train, properly stopping at six stops, when he was only 16. Since then, he has illegally driven 22 more trains and buses. He has never threatened or injured anyone or damaged any property. Recently, a Greyhound bus driver pulled into the Port Authority in Manhattan. The passengers and driver left the bus.

She knew how to change a tire. She opened the trunk and looked for the spare. Did someone steal my spare, she wondered. She opened the glove compartment and thumbed through the new-smelling owner’s guide. On page 38, it said, \"In order to better serve owners, we have not provided this vehicle with an emergency tire. In case of a flat, owners should call their preferred towing service.\" How am I better served, she wondered, by not having a spare tire? Would they sell jeans without a secret pocket? Would they sell nail clippers without a file? Would they sell a pot without a lid? Would they sell a toy without a battery? Toy companies started it, she decided.",

I’ll bet one-fifth of American kids don’t know what animal their hamburgers come from. They probably don’t even know where their milk comes from. What are they teaching our kids nowadays? They should be learning hands-on stuff, like milking cows, shucking corn, and feeding chickens. Whatever happened to 4-H Clubs?\" Their 14-year-old daughter came home from school. Paul asked, \"Honey, where does pork come from?\" She said, \"Pigs.\" He asked, \"Where does lamb come from?\" She said, \"Sheep.\" He asked, \"Where does money for your books and clothes come from?\" She said, \"I’m not sure.

  "A man pulled out his .38 caliber revolver and shot a waitress at 2 a.m. after she asked him to smoke his cigarette outside. She died during the ambulance trip to the hospital. The 24/7 restaurant closed during the 3-hour police investigation, but reopened afterward. A witness to the murder told police that the waitress \"could’ve asked more politely.\" During the shutdown, the restaurant manager called a day-shift waitress and promised her double-time. When she arrived, he told her, \"If someone tries to light up, don’t say a word. Two shootings in one night will finish us.\" After checking with the police chief, the restaurant owner instituted a new employee policy regarding would-be smokers. No longer will waitresses ask a customer not to smoke. That will be the manager’s responsibility. While the manager points at the big No Smoking sign, he’ll also be pointing a loaded pistol at the customer.",
  "One day Mom told her son-in-law, \"I love that car. If you ever decide to sell it, I’ll give you $5,000 for it.\" Barney snorted. \"The sound system alone is worth $5,000.\" Taken aback, Mom said, \"Well, one can hardly drive a sound system down the road.\" Two years later, Barney decided to sell the car. Abby knew that Mom loved it, but she also knew that Barney wanted bluebook value for their car. Abby talked to her siblings. They all agreed to buy the car for Mom for $20,000. They surprised her with it a month later. Mom said, \"What’s this?\" Abby said, \"You wanted it, so now it’s yours.\" Mom said, \"No, I wanted it for $5,000, not for whatever you all must have paid for it. Now, I wouldn’t take it for $5.

We’ll be back whenever.\" He said, \"You know, you can’t trust those stores. They suck you in with their holiday decorations, but once you’re in there they want to keep you there until you’ve bought twice what you intended to buy. They trick you with all their fine print. They trick you with all their prices ending in 9.99. They trick you with all their gift cards that expire a week later. They trick you with the hues of their walls, the types of their music, and the placement of their goods. They have more tricks up their sleeves than Santa has lumps of coal.\" She said, \"Hello! Was I born yesterday? I’ll show Sharon all their tricks. Don’t worry, dear, your money will be safe with us.\"",
  "Everyone was in the living room after the Thanksgiving meal. Erin said, \"Sunday was Brevyn’s twelfth birthday. I thought it’d be nice to give him an additional gift today, so I’m passing this hat around. Put a bill in it, and he can pick one out.\" After all the bills were in the hat, Erin called Brevyn inside. She held the hat above eye level. He felt around for a bit and pulled out a twenty. Everyone clapped. Erin passed the hat around for family members to retrieve their money. Mike and Gary got into an argument over the last twenty remaining in the hat. After Mike lost the argument, Brevyn walked over and handed him the twenty. Later, Erin told Brevyn how impressed she was. He said, \"I thought you were going to surprise me by giving me everything in the hat. Twenty dollars is for the kiddie table.\"",
  "At the first family Thanksgiving after Dad’s death, Mom made a heartfelt speech about how much help Dewey had been in the ensuing months. She presented her son a gift from the family — an expensive medallion for his keychain. An inscription was on one side and an engraving of Dad’s likeness on the other. Completely surprised and faltering, Dewey thanked everyone, saying he was just helping out. \"If you wanted to give me something, a T-shirt would’ve been fine,\" he said. Riding in Dewey’s truck a month later, Craig asked, \"Where’s the medallion? I don’t see it on your keychain.\" Dewey said, \"I hate to say this, but I don’t like the engraving. It doesn’t look like Dad. When I think of Dad, I want to think of my Dad, not the engraver’s dad. It’s in a drawer.\" Craig said, \"I told them to get you a bottle of Crown.\"",

She dropped by the pharmacy at 3:57 to make a copy of her four-page application. The sign on the pharmacy door said Saturday 10-4. No!, she thought. She crossed the street to a realty office, where a worker kindly copied Shirley’s application. Yes!, she thought. She strolled toward the post office. The sign on the post office door said Saturday 8-4. No!, she thought.

  "His family knew that whenever Alec said he planned to visit on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day, he might not show up. Alec had schizophrenia. If his \"demons\" attacked him, he had to stay home and wait them out in private. A week before last Christmas, Alec told Mom that he was coming to the family get-together. He continued, \"But don’t tell Carter. I’m going to call him and tell him that I’m not coming, and then I’m going to surprise him.\" Alec enjoyed playing that trick occasionally. On Christmas Day, Alec tapped his brother on the shoulder and said, \"Surprise!\" Carter was happy to see him. Alec asked, \"Did I surprise you?\" Carter said, \"Well, not really. We all know that you’re 50 percent regardless of what you say. In fact, the only time that you’ll really surprise us is if you stop thinking that you can surprise us.\"",

Deon started yelling, \"How many times have I told you to mop up all the — ?\" He went silent. He walked away and sat down on the sofa. Ezra knew why his dad had walked away just as he was getting warmed up. It was the anger sensor. A year ago an inventor, Thomas Alva, had gotten angry about all the anger in the world. Anger causes more pain and sorrow than all the diseases put together, he thought. He invented an anger sensor that was embedded in satellites blanketing Earth. Detecting anger, the sensor replaced it by beaming beautiful music to the individual.

It’s been an immigrant city from the very beginning in 1626, when Puerto Ricans purchased Manhattan from the First Immigrants for 24 chickens. But centuries later, we still have immigrants hiding in the shadows. No más! Our Shine in the Sun plan guarantees that immigrants will become valued community members. First, we issued NYC ID cards to every immigrant living here. Next, we made every immigrant eligible to vote in city elections and sit on jury duty. Third, we made every immigrant eligible to run for city office. Finally, I’m running for mayor next year.

In the last six games, 12 was the Mega number twice — in a row! Something’s rotten in Denmark.\" She said, \"Something’s rotten in your brain. There’re 15 Mega numbers.

  "Celine selected her best friend from a litter. \"When I looked at her and she looked at me, I knew right off we were soulmates,\" Celine always said. For five years, she and Bondie \"took care of each other.\" Then Bondie somehow got outside one day, and some \"speeding idiot\" ran her over. It was the saddest day of Celine’s life. Weeks later, her boyfriend Ivan surprised her with a kitten that looked exactly like Bondie as a kitten. That wasn’t a coincidence; Celine had hundreds of photos of Bondie. Celine was surprised and, at first, grateful. Then, she took the kitten to an animal shelter. Visiting Celine shortly afterward, Ivan asked, \"Where’s Bondie II?\" Celine said, \"Bondie II made me depressed. All she did was remind me of Bondie. I need to try to forget Bondie.\" Ivan said, \"I understand.\" The next day, he brought Celine a Yorkie puppy.",
  "Connie and Libby were discussing a contrary Presidential candidate. Libby demanded, \"How can you not be offended by that rude, vulgar, sexist, un-American, bigoted, racist, populist demagogue?\" Connie said, \"Wow! That’s a mouthful!\" Libby said, \"Well, that’s what the TV anchors call him every night.\" Connie said, \"Yet they berate him for name-calling. He’s about as ’un-American’ as apple pie; he’s a capitalist! A bigot can’t abide other groups or religions. A racist believes that his race is superior. Have you ever heard him say that he can’t stand certain groups or religions, or that whites are Numero Uno? A populist supports the rights and power of the people. That’s bad?! A demagogue gets power by appealing to voters’ emotions and prejudices. What candidate hasn’t tried that? Regardless, once The Donald ’gets’ power, he won’t be a demagogue — he’ll be the President!\" Libby said, \"Yes, a rude, vulgar, sexist one.\"",
  "Today, January 1, is my dad’s birthday. He would have been 88, having passed away March 31, 2015. My mom went to the cemetery today. I never thought I would miss Dad as much as I miss him now. I’m afraid that, as I got older myself, I sort of took him for granted. He had been there for me every day of my young life. He and Mom raised eight kids, and we all loved him. He was smart, brave, and fun. In the last 50 years, I visited Dad and Mom occasionally and phoned them regularly. Sometimes Dad was talkative and joking, but sometimes he didn’t say much. I’ll always wonder, How much did I disappoint him? I wish I could have been not only a better son, but also one of his better friends. But more than all that, I just wish I could see him again.",

She bumped him a few more times in the next couple of minutes. Irritated, he stood his ground. Finally, the worker finished with the customer on Jody’s left. Jody ordered a quarter-pound of turkey. Just then, another worker got free and asked Jody, \"Can I help you?\" Jody said, \"Yes, a half-pound of — \" The matron, nearly leaning on Jody, said loudly, \"A pound of salmon.\" Then she turned to Jody and said, \"You can’t have two workers helping you.

Wanting their people to breathe fresher air, some smaller countries are experimenting with cigarette \"presentation.\" Kengland turned to Acme Mind Shapers, which created a three-phase Stamp Out Smoking campaign that Kengland implemented. First, media and print ads appeared everywhere, pronouncing, \"Smoking — a stupid habit for stupid people.\" The ads showed dorks trying to look cool while lighting, holding, smoking, or discarding cigarettes. Next, cigarette packs lost their logos, slogans, and vivid colors. Every cigarette pack was plain brown. The brand name was in small black print above a grinning devil. Beneath the devil were large, red letters saying, \"Enjoy Your Emphysema.\" Finally, phase three made further use of the psychology of color. Standard white cigarette paper was replaced with a new standard — bright pink.",

He did it to encourage more Americans to get tested for HIV. His point was that if he could row across the Atlantic, they could get tested for HIV.\" Lou said, \"That’s a lot of rowing for nothing.

Ryan was going for another swig when the accident occurred. His two passengers died instantly. Unmarked, Ryan lived to drive, and perhaps kill, again. Prosecutors tried him for manslaughter, but his wealthy parents hired a lawyer who presented an \"affluenza\" defense. She told the jury that Ryan’s parents had doted on him from birth. Spoiled and \"special,\" he grew up thinking that rules, regulations, and laws — including laws about driving under the influence — applied only to others. Amazingly, the jury bought into her argument. Ryan received community service. After the trial ended, a juror told a reporter, \"We felt his pain. Not having his two best friends to pal around with anymore is enough of a price to pay for bad parenting.\"",

The building manager had already reminded him that the new tenant was waiting. Nathan’s son and a building maintenance worker were helping Nathan move to the seventh floor. To Nathan’s relief, at 5 p.m. everything had been moved into his new office. Everything except one thing — $1 million worth of loose diamonds. After frantically searching everywhere the following morning, Nathan called NYPD. Officers viewed a surveillance tape and arrested the security guard. The worker had innocently put a couple of small boxes into the hallway trash pile, which the guard later dug through. The guard, who’d already sold two diamonds for $30,000, said, \"When they hired me, they didn’t tell me there was surveillance in the hallways. They set me up. I’m no thief.\"",

When the two walkers met up, Marco said, \"Curtis, I wish you’d run for President. You’d have my vote.\" Curtis grinned, thanked him, and continued on. When Marco got home, he said, \"I just ran into Curtis Sliwa. That guy’s a real American. A fast-talking, fist-fighting, flag-flying American.

  "In East Flatbush about 9 p.m., 15-year-old Brook was walking with his dad through a poorly lit park. Five young males approached. Waggling a knife under Foster’s nose, one male told Foster, who was drunk, to move along without his son. Foster hesitatingly shuffled off. Walking into a nearby bodega, he slurred his words while asking for help. Smelling his breath, the bodega owner said, \"Get out of here!\" Meandering another few blocks, Foster saw a parked NYPD car. The officers drove him back to the park. They found Brook beaten up and relieved of his cell phone and pricey Nikes. After DNAinfo.com reported the attack, social media users lambasted the city for the park’s poor lighting, the bodega owner for ignoring Foster’s plea, NYPD for not parking nearer the park, Brook for wearing new sneakers in a bad neighborhood, and Foster for being a sot and deserting his son.",

Thousands of Americans die each year from hospital-acquired infections, while hundreds of thousands more get sick but survive. Betsy MacCoy, who’s been railing against America’s unhealthy hospitals for years, said, \"Hospitals cost us money, but they’re also as filthy as money. Doctors transport virulent bacteria on their ties and their stethoscopes from one patient’s room to another. Hospital staff, particularly doctors and nurses, fail to scrub their hands before entering each patient’s room. But worst of all, custodians fail to disinfect doorknobs, bedrails, and TV remotes daily. I always tell people, if you have a loved one in the hospital, don’t show how much you care by bringing them chocolates or flowers.",

The clerk called the police, who caught the firefighter as he finished the sandwich and disposed of its plastic wrapper in a city trashcan. After being convicted of stealing $8 worth of merchandise, he lost his job. His only excuse for the theft was that he hadn’t had any cash on him at the time. His girlfriend asked, \"What kind of excuse is that? What were you thinking? You forfeit $75,000 a year for a stupid $8 sandwich?\" He said, \"I don’t know.

It’s not a ’lizard’ warning — it’s a ’blizzard’ warning. A blizzard is a super snowstorm, so we don’t have to worry about lizards eating us or the pets.

It demanded less mold, better stairwell lighting, more security guards, and fewer rats in city housing. It demanded less police harassment of the 54,000 homeless who occasionally spit, pee, poo, and sleep on city sidewalks. The council speaker said, \"They’re homeless. Where else are they going to do all that?\" It demanded that the Wall Street one-percenters quit accepting their annual fat bonuses.

  "Dick was a slender 140-pounder. Tommy, his office coworker, was a beefy 180-pounder. They were both 26. Tommy got a kick out of adding hot sauce to Dick’s unattended cup of coffee. The third time Tommy did it, Dick confronted him. Dick said, \"I don’t appreciate your little joke. People like you think people like me are pushovers. I grew up in Thailand. I was a martial arts fighter throughout my teens.

  "Rocky was a new worker in the office. Many workers had staggered schedules. So, during Rocky’s shift, various individuals finished their shifts. As they left the office, they said \"Goodbye\" or \"Goodbye, everyone\" and many of their coworkers responded. Silent, Rocky kept his face buried in his proofreading. When he finished his shift, he usually said only a quiet goodbye to his supervisor. His coworkers noticed this. They started murmuring. Their murmurs got back to his supervisor. She took Rocky aside one day. \"Your coworkers think maybe you think you’re too good for them. Maybe they’re not worth saying goodbye to.\" He said, \"Not at all. It’s just that I’m new, and a little insecure. When I was eight, I had a birthday party, and only one kid showed up — my little brother! Ever since then, I’ve feared rejection.",

  "After California’s liberal Governor Moonbeam signed a bill allowing that state’s noncitizens to vote in any and all elections, further alienating the state’s ignored and angry citizens, the New York legislature, whose motto could be Everyone Is Entitled to Everything, passed a similar bill, which was quickly signed by NY’s ultra-liberal governor. But the NY bill had a little extra something. It not only allowed noncitizens to vote, but it allowed noncitizens’ families to vote — even if they lived in another country. When asked why the NY bill allowed people living in entirely different countries to vote in local and national elections in the United States, Governor Giveaway said, \"Well, first of all, it increases voter turnout. We have too many elections with too little participation. Second, it helps spread the idea of and participation in democracy worldwide.",

Trump’s PR spokesman — that is, The Donald himself — quickly responded, \"Wait a minute. What about all those school kids raising their hands in classrooms all across America?

Years ago, it was all about Mom, baseball, and apple pie. But maybe not. Maybe America — whose settlers murdered First Americans and enslaved Africans — has always been, or has always been becoming, a country of conservatives versus liberals, pro-choice versus pro-life, guns versus no guns, straights versus gays, rich versus poor, owners versus workers, Christians versus other Christians and non-Christians, and neighbor versus neighbor. A country of free speech — if it doesn’t offend anyone. A country of assassinations, lynchings, gerrymandering, riots, mass shootings, serial killers, liars, thieves, cheats, hypocrites, drunk drivers, prisoners, homeless, jobless, and corrupt politicians, officials, and businessmen. A country that bullies others. A country that breaks treaties and starts wars. The country that created ISIS. Maybe Trump is what this country is all about.",

It gives suspects the dignity of being free instead of locked up like animals. It allows suspects to be with their families, which fosters responsibility and togetherness. It gives suspects money to spend, which contributes to the local economy. And it reduces the number of correction officers, cooks, and other support staff needed at Rikers Island.

  "On June 30, NYC City Council Speaker Nolauza Pynywher announced, \"We’ve just passed my bill regarding so-called criminals at Rikers Island.

Everyone makes mistakes; everyone deserves a second chance — or more. As it costs $96,000 annually to house each prisoner, my bill saves taxpayers $60,000 per ex-prisoner. Further, each so-called criminal becomes an honest wage-earner, each of their checks, when spent, contributes to our economy, and most important, each and every NYC resident can stop worrying about crime. All our so-called criminals will be respectable wage-earners who are no longer forced to mug or rob their fellow residents in order to get by.\"",

  "NYC is now providing free diapers for all. Announced a city council member, \"This is just part of our care package to feed, educate, and clothe all our kids. Kids get free education, starting with pre-K, till they graduate high school. Because kids can’t learn anything while their stomachs are growling, they get free breakfast and lunch throughout the year, including summertime — even if they’re not attending school. Some people ask why, but the reason is obvious: If we’re feeding them for nine months, we might as well feed them for twelve. The diapers came about because children with no diapers, or dirty diapers, develop rashes and other symptoms that require parental or medical care, thus jeopardizing the child’s health and possibly impacting their parents’ work routine and income. So we’re just being proactive. The same people ask, Who’s paying for all this? The government — so don’t worry about it.\"",

  "He said, \"This guy on TV said he checked out all the world’s best-selling pillows, but couldn’t find one that was comfortable. I wonder how much money and time that took. So he created his own pillow company. He guarantees his pillow — ’only’ $100 — is the most comfortable pillow you’ll ever use. And if you don’t like it, you can return it within 100 days.\" His wife said, \"So, are you going to buy one — or two?\" He said, \"Honey, it’s returnable. After 100 days. Can you imagine what’s on a pillow after 100 days?\" She said, \"I’m sure they throw out the returned ones.\" He said, \"$100 pillows? I’m sure they don’t.

  "A Bronx high school principal proposed unisex restrooms. He said, \"America is all about freedom. Students should have the freedom to use whichever restroom they want. Signage saying Boys or Girls is sexist. Students don’t feel comfortable doing their business in a sexist restroom.\" Approving his proposal, the board of education immediately established unisex bathrooms in all five boroughs. Encouraged, the principal had another bright idea. He proposed that graduating high school students all wear the same color cap and gown, because using purple gowns for males and white gowns for females \"creates separateness rather than togetherness.\" The board quickly instituted his proposal. Inspired by the principal’s ideas, Gotham’s mayor announced three executive orders. One removed gender signage from all city agency restrooms, another banned the use of Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Miss when addressing or referring to city workers, and another required all city workers to wear beige uniforms.",

He hadn’t talked to her since she divorced him five years after their wedding. She turned their daughter Julie against him, so Ike and Julie never talked either. Grace and Julie worked as waitresses at a 24-hour truck stop. Grace said, \"Did Mom leave the house to Julie?\" Ike snorted. Her voice rose. \"Do you know how many times I used to drag Julie over there to visit Mom? I always told Julie, right in front of Mom, ’Someday this beautiful house will be all yours, honey, because Grandma loves you so much.

Then I showed the worker your picture on my phone. She smiled. We had fun while we were there — I thought. But on the phone just now, you said don’t ever say that again.

The MTA should cut the ticket price in half for our poor — and keep it there. It’s insult to injury when you have to pay top dollar to get to your minimum wage job. And MTA piles on the insults with its nearly annual price increases.\" Ned said, \"That’s a great idea for the poor, but it’s a bad idea for the middle class. The less the poor have to pay for tickets — not to mention everything else! — the more the rest of us have to pay. Helping the poor is making us all poor.\" Thomas said, \"That’s okay.

Firefighters would have to rescue injured drivers and passengers behind them, while in front of them buildings burned and fire victims leaped to their deaths.\" Loving the logic, the mayor of the Big Apple ordered the removal of both U.S. flags from the Brooklyn Bridge. He said, \"Now our First Lady is safe from distracted chopper pilots.\"",
  "Rudy and Ruby were trying to keep it civilized. Rudy said, \"How can you? Just because she’s a woman? Wake up! She’s a ’sister,’ but she’s going to run Big Brother. She’s going to be in charge of a political, financial, and media machine that even now is trying to control every facet of our daily lives. That machine’s going to make ’1984’ look like Nirvana.\" Ruby said, \"Oh, the sky is falling! The lies about her are nothing compared to the truth about him, the silver spoon brat who ’matured’ into a ’dirty old man.’ He hates browns and blacks. He hates women. He’s a business failure and a born liar!\" Rudy said, \"She’s a bigger born liar! Go ahead, vote for the machine. I’m voting for him. He’s not part of any machine. He’s flawed, but he’s human flesh and blood. He stands alone, but he stands tall.\"",
  "Bill, the building super, held open the hinged, exterior elevator door of the old apartment building for Tom. Tom, a long-time tenant, thanked him. Still holding the door, Bill said, \"C’mon! People are waiting.\" His 12-year-old grandson Jud sashayed into the elevator. The interior door slid shut and the elevator rose from the lobby. Bill said, \"Say hello to Mr. Tom.\" Jud ignored his grandfather and Tom. Bill repeated himself, adding, \"He’s the owner of the building.\" Jud said, \"Really?! Hi, Mr. Tom!\" Jud’s big smile looked almost genuine to Tom, who hardly liked the lad. Laughing, Tom said to Bill, \"I wish!\" The elevator stopped at the second floor. Bill and Jud exited. Tom heard Jud ask, \"What’s he wishing for?\" Tom told his wife about the elevator conversation, adding, \"I wish Bill wouldn’t say things like that. In a few years, the kid’ll probably try to rob us.\"",
  "Paula and Wes, Manhattan attorneys, used the same car service. David’s friendliness had prompted each of them, months ago, to ask him to become their regular driver. One day at work, however, Paula said, \"I love David, so I don’t want to hurt his feelings, or his income. But his driving is so, um, uneven.\" Wes said, \"Or, um, scary! I owe him a long overdue talk.\" The next night, before exiting David’s car, Wes said, \"David, Paula and I like you, but we’re thinking of changing drivers. You slam on the brakes. You step on the gas. You don’t slow down for potholes. I feel like I’m on the Cyclone back here! You’ve got to start driving like we’re trying to drink a cup of hot coffee back here.",
  "Laura and Bill had been out of touch. They accidentally met near The Halal Guys line on W 53rd. Laura asked, \"So, what’s new?\" Bill said, \"Well, I shouldn’t brag, but I just discovered a cure for cancer.\" Laura said, \"You mean some blue moon variety that attacks only three-legged mice?\" Bill laughed. \"No, I mean the everyday variety that causes lung cancer, skin cancer, and every other cancer.\" Laura gasped. \"No! And this isn’t all over the front page?! Yesterday, every news channel featured some guy who invented a new cure for hiccups! But you’ve discovered the cure for cancer and nobody knows about it?!\" Bill said, \"Well, the media were about to broadcast my discovery nationwide, but then they discovered my dirty little secret and killed the story.\" Laura asked, \"Dirty little secret? You’re not a serial killer, are you?\" Bill said, \"Worse! I’m a life-long Republican.\"",
  "It was yearbook picture day for Ruby’s senior class. A high school tradition, yearbooks are keepsakes that seniors pore over long after they were seniors. The excitement of picture day had kept Ruby up late the night before. Upon awaking, she went into the bathroom. She screamed. Alarmed, her dad knocked on the bathroom door. \"Honey, are you okay?\" She said, \"Yes, Daddy. I’m okay. No, I’m not okay!\" Dad said, \"You’re okay, but you’re not okay. What’s not okay? Do you want to tell me, or do you want to tell your mom?\" Ruby said, \"Daddy, I have the world’s grossest pimple on my nose!\" Her dad said, \"A pimple? A pimple! So pop it, honey. It’s just a pimple!\" She said, \"Just a pimple? Just a pimple! It’s picture day, Dad! There’s no such thing as ’just a pimple’ today!\" Ruby started bawling. Dad went to get mom.",
  "\"He’s the worst president we’ve ever had!\" Betty said. Her brother said, \"How can you say that? You just watched him being sworn in. He’s been POTUS for nine seconds!\" She said, \"So what?! He’s the worst ever! He’s a menace to women, to immigrants, and to our government!\" Eddie said, \"Excuse me?! His two exes praise him. His adult daughter — not to mention all his female employees — adores him. His wife and one ex-wife are immigrants. His whole life, he’s had to deal with governments at every level, here and abroad, to get million-dollar projects done on time and under budget. What more do you want?\" She said, \"I want Don gone — now, before he gets us all killed! He’s a sexist, a sham without shame, a hoax on America’s folks.\"",
  "John’s tankless toilet often failed to \"gulp,\" his word for the sound it made after it \"swallowed.\" If it doesn’t gulp, I have to reflush; if reflushing fails, I have to plunge, John always said. Recently, both actions had tediously become part of the routine whenever John used his throne. Finally, he told the super, who tested the toilet. He said, \"The flush is weak. I’ll order a new bowl, because it’s also leaking. Your downstairs neighbor has a small — for now — ’bubble’ on his ceiling. He says you flush ’10,000 times’ a day. If you ever notice that the water level is low, call me ASAP and do not flush again, although it might be too late.\" Next day, John flushed but heard no gulp. He flushed again, and again — and again. The water level suddenly lowered. Uh-oh, John thought. Moments later, someone was banging on his door.",
  "Holly, the supervisor, called Will into her Manhattan office. She said, \"Today, you said hello to everyone in the office, by name, except Andy. Ditto, yesterday. Anything I should know?\" Will said, \"Have you ever greeted someone and they didn’t respond? And you greeted them the next day, and they ignored you again?\" Holly nodded. \"Well, since I started working here last week, Andy’s ignored my hellos. Once, I even loudly repeated ’Good morning, Andy,’ and he grunted without even looking up. Whenever I say hi, he’s too ’busy’ with his paperwork to reply. But, he replies to everyone else.\" Holly said, \"You must’ve done or said something that offended him. He’s very sensitive.\" Will said, \"Well, so am I.\" She said, \"I’ll talk to him. You’re going to be working together, so it helps if you’re on friendlier terms. This office is frigid enough without adding two cold shoulders.\"",
  "He said, \"I’m not renewing five of  my nine magazine subscriptions.\" She said, \"I don’t blame you. They’re all too expensive.\" He said, \"They’re all too liberal — meaning, they’re all fake news! Blatant lies and lies of omission. I don’t get it. News is their life, but they don’t see the biggest news story of all — America’s the new France! They’re like the frog in the pot of slowly boiling water. They see the first bubbles — Bowling Green, Boston, San Bernardino — but they don’t think they’re important. They’re just a small price to pay for poorly vetted immigration. We can live with the occasional jihadist, right? Ten here, 50 there — why, that’s nothing compared to drunk drivers. Well, I’ve had enough. Every article in these magazines is tainted by their hatred of Trump. I can’t believe anything they print.\" She said, \"Nothing?!\" He said, \"I’m okay with the page numbers.\"",
  "Noemi entered her brownstone and turned on the TV. A man in mid-sentence said, \"its soft undertones of sweet almond, viscous buttery texture, balanced bitterness, and elongated peppery finish.\" Noemi wondered what he was talking about. She’d never tasted a \"sweet\" almond. But, if you add sugar and butter, you’d get almond butter. Add some water, and it’s viscous. The \"bitterness\" puzzled her. Maybe they used almonds that weren’t quite ripe. How could bitterness be \"balanced\"? You taste it on both sides of your tongue, instead of just on the left side? \"Finish\" had to be fancy talk for \"taste.\" \"Peppery\" must mean they added chili peppers to the almond butter. And \"elongated\" must mean that you have to fan your open mouth for a few minutes after tasting the almond butter. The TV camera zoomed in on a bottle of olive oil. \"Olive oil?!\" she yelled at the TV.",
  "Lucy said, \"My boss is a real Scrooge. He thinks Christmas trees, lights, and decorations should be up for one week only.\" Ethel said, \"He should work at Rockefeller Center. I was driving by the skating rink the other night at 11:45 and guess what — the tree wasn’t lit! A week before Christmas, not even midnight yet, and the tree was a conical lump of coal. That same night, the Seaport tree and the Bryant Park tree were glittering gems at 2 a.m. But the grandest tree in America — America’s Christmas tree! — was put to bed before midnight. This city never sleeps — neither should its Christmas tree!\" Lucy said, \"It’s a disgrace, especially after they make such a big TV to-do of lighting it up!\" Ethel said, \"It’s not just a disgrace. It’s a New York disgrace!\" Lucy said, \"It’s not just a New York disgrace.",
  "Laura said, \"I’m taking my sign to West 56th to protest Trump’s plan to remove immigrants. How dare he! We’re all immigrants. Even the First Americans were immigrants. What’s he going to do, remove us all? He should remove himself — first.\" Rob said, \"Hello! English is your only language, so you should know better. He’s not planning to remove immigrants. He’s planning to remove illegal immigrants. That’s two words, not one word. Two words, as you know, have a different meaning than one word. For example, you scoop ice cream, but you pour cream. You eat a hot dog, but you pet a dog. You drive a fire engine, but you fix an engine.\" Laura said, \"Wrong, as in Totally Wrong. Everyone knows there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant, so you can’t even put those two words together.",
  "Gracie said, \"What are you reading?\" George said, \"A textbook — Elementary Russian.\" She said, \"You’re learning a second language? Good for you! But why Russian?\" He said, \"Haven’t you heard? The fake news is real news! Trump did make a deal with Putin! Trump said America’s media was helping Hillary, so it was only fair that Russia’s president help him. As part of the deal, Trump gets Manhattan, which he’s renaming Trump Island. As the other part, Putin moves into the White House and becomes President of the Union of Soviet America. He promises jobs for everyone — as long as you speak Russian. If you don’t speak it by next year, he says you can learn it at your leisure — in Siberia.\" Gracie said, \"Oh, my gosh! I can’t learn Russian. Their letters are backward! I’m so stupid.",
  "He said, \"I’m losing it. I forgot the name of the candy I was eating — while I was eating it! And it wasn’t a brand new candy that I’d never eaten before. It wasn’t a candy with a fancy-schmancy foreign name. It was a famous brand with a simple name that I grew up with. Finally, when I couldn’t think of the name, I looked at the box — Milk Duds!\" She said, \"Well, that doesn’t mean you’re losing it. All that sugar just shorted out a few of your brain’s memory cells.\" He said, \"But, that’s never happened to me — yet! — while I was munching on M&Ms or Hershey Kisses. No, this forgetting’s been ongoing. I’m losing it. I’m the one who knows best that I’m losing it — but nobody believes me.",

Come to think of it, why should only citizens be able to vote? That’s not fair.\" Sara said, \"Why can’t people with green cards vote?\" Bob said, \"Why can’t people with student visas vote?\" Sara said, \"Why can’t people without green cards or student visas vote?\" Bob said, \"Why can’t people hiding in the shadows vote?\" Sara said, \"In fact, why can’t people everywhere vote?\" Bob said, \"Everywhere?\" Sara said, \"You know.
